_UNK_ 1 ... thank you so much .
that 's so nice .
is n't he a great guy .
he does n't get a fair press ; he does n't get it .
it 's just not fair .
and i have to tell you i 'm here , and very strongly here , because i have great respect for steve king and have great respect likewise for citizens united , david and everybody , and tremendous _UNK_ for the tea party .
also , also the people of iowa .
they have something in common .
_UNK_ people .
they want to work , they want to make the country great .
i love the people of iowa .
so that 's the way it is .
very simple .
with that said , our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job .
the world is _UNK_ around us , and many of the problems we 've caused .
our president is either _UNK_ _UNK_ , a word that more and more people are using , and i think i was the first to use it , or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about , which could be possible .
in any event , washington is broken , and our country is in serious trouble and total _UNK_ .
very simple .
politicians are all talk , no action .
they are all talk and no action .
and it 's constant ; it never ends .
and i 'm a conservative , actually very conservative , and i 'm a republican .
and i 'm very _UNK_ by our republican politicians .
because they let the president get away with absolute murder .
you see always , oh we 're going to do this , we 're going to -- .
nothing ever happens ; nothing ever happens .
you look at obamacare .
a total catastrophe and by the way it really _UNK_ in in _UNK_ and it is going to be a disaster .
people are closing up _UNK_ .
doctors are quitting the business .
i have a friend of mine who 's a doctor , a very good doctor , a very successful guy .
he said , i have more accountants than i have patients .
and he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he 's never had that before and he 's going to close up his business .
and he was very successful guy .
but it 's happening more and more .
look at obamacare with a $ 5 billion website .
i have many websites , many , many websites .
they 're all over the place .
but for $ 10 , okay ?
now everything about obamacare was a lie .
it was a _UNK_ lie .
and when you think about it , lies , i mean are they prosecuted ?
does anyone do anything ?
and what are the republican politicians doing about it ?
he _UNK_ about the doctor , he _UNK_ about every aspect .
you can keep your plan .
and you 've all heard that hundreds of times .
that 's like the real _UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
i do n't even say it anymore because everybody goes _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
but you have heard this about obamacare .
and it 's _UNK_ .
it 's a big , _UNK_ , _UNK_ lie .
your _UNK_ are going through the roof .
you 're not going to get -- unless you 're hit by an army _UNK_ , you 're not going to get coverage .
and people that had plans that they loved , that they really loved , do n't have those plans anymore .
so it 's a real , real disaster .
and somebody has to repeal and replace obamacare .
and they have to do it fast and not just talk about it .
now , we have to build a _UNK_ .
and it 's got to be a beauty .
who can build better than trump ?
i build ; it 's what i do .
i build ; i build nice _UNK_ , but i build great buildings .
_UNK_ are easy , believe me .
i saw the other day on television people just walking across the border .
they 're walking .
the military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front , coming into our country .
it is so terrible .
it is so unfair .
it is so _UNK_ .
and we do n't have the best coming in .
we have people that are criminals , we have people that are _UNK_ .
you can certainly have terrorists .
you can certainly have islamic terrorists .
you can have anything coming across the border .
we do n't do anything about it .
so i would say that if i run and if i win , i would certainly start by building a very , very powerful border .
again , the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it .
benghazi .
oh , benghazi , benghazi .
everything is benghazi .
what happens ?
nothing .
irs , e-mails .
i get _UNK_ all the time , okay .
i run a big business .
you know i 've always said it 's very , very hard for a person who is very successful .
i have done so many deals .
almost all of them have been _UNK_ successful .
you 'll see that when i file my statements .
i mean you will see ; you will be very proud of me , okay .
but i 've always said , and i said it strongly , it 's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics , run for political office , any office , let alone president .
because you 've done so much ; you 've beaten so many people ; you 've created so many -- look , obama , what did he do ?
no deal .
he never did a deal .
he did one deal .
a house .
and if you did that house you 'd be in jail right now , okay .
he got away with murder .
but i can tell you , e-mails .
irs , the e-mails , thousands of them , they were lost ; they were lost .
if you were in my world you would know that e-mails ca n't be lost ; they ca n't be lost .
so why are n't our politicians finding out where those e-mails are ?
they talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border ; that 's the end of it .
believe me if i did something you would have a border that would be great .
but they talk about it .
and then you have a president that does an executive order .
nobody even heard of an executive order .
he does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders .
why did n't they go to court and ask for _UNK_ judgment -- which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it 's in writing , and he 's been saying it for a long time ; he said , i 'm going to _UNK_ this and that -- why did n't our republicans go in and get a _UNK_ judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier .
instead they have a weak _UNK_ , that probably the time it 's finished , i know so much about this , six , seven , eight years from now everyone 's going to forget about it .
we 'll be into a different _UNK_ , and our country will be further destroyed .
so we have to do something .
jobs .
china .
i mean i 've made so much money fighting against the chinese .
one of the best deals i ever did was against the chinese , and they respect me for it .
and i know them .
and they say , we ca n't believe what we 're getting away with .
we ca n't believe how _UNK_ your leaders are .
they tell me that .
now they do n't know i 'm going to go and make a speech about it , but why not .
but they tell me that .
and by the way , especially for the folks here that sell so much -- goods , i mean the goods you sell are incredible ; i do n't know if you 've been watching what 's happening with the _UNK_ of so many countries .
the _UNK_ , china is going _UNK_ with the _UNK_ .
i never thought that they 'd have the _UNK_ to do what they 're doing .
they are _UNK_ down to nothing .
and what it 's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product ; it 's going make it impossible for you to compete .
and they 're getting away with it .
and they would n't have even done it two years ago , but now they feel we 're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it .
but you watch this _UNK_ of all of it .
i mean the _UNK_ , china , mexico ; everybody is _UNK_ .
and when you hear the dollar is getting stronger , it sounds good .
you know it 's one of those things , sounds good .
be very careful .
be very careful .
because we 're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing .
they have it set .
do n't forget another thing .
china became the number one economic power a year ago .
that was unthinkable ; to think that that was going to happen .
it was absolutely unthinkable .
so it happened and it 's very , very _UNK_ .
now we spent $ 2 trillion in iraq .
we got nothing .
they do n't even respect us ; they do n't even care about us .
until they started getting their _UNK_ kicked , and call , oh please come back and help us .
we want you out ; then all of the sudden a new group forms , isis .
by the way , you know how they formed .
they took the oil .
and for those of you that know and love donald trump -- there are some of you -- have i been saying for four years , keep the oil .
so now isis has the oil .
and the stuff that isis does n't have , iran is going to take .
so we get nothing .
we have $ 2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost , thousands , and we have , what do we have .
i mean i walk down the streets of new york and i see so many wounded warriors , incredible people .
and we have to help those people , we have to help our vets , we have to help our military , we have to build our military .
but , and we have to do it fast ; we have to do it fast .
we have _UNK_ people .
they put people in charge that have no _UNK_ what they 're doing .
it needs money .
we have to make our country rich again so we do that , so we can save social security .
_UNK_ i 'm not a _UNK_ ; i 'll probably be the only republican that does not want to cut social security .
i 'm not a _UNK_ of social security ; i want to make the country rich so that social security can be _UNK_ , and medicare and medicaid .
get rid of the waste , get rid of the fraud , but you deserve your social security ; you 've been paying your security .
and like , i like congressman ryan , i like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting social security , and by the way the democrats are eating your lunch on this issue .
it 's an issue that you 're not going to win ; you 've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it , and so you can afford military , and all of the other things .
now , we have a game _UNK_ now , and the game _UNK_ is nuclear weapons .
we really do have to get strong , and we have to get strong fast .
we ca n't let iran get a nuclear weapon .
we ca n't do it .
ca n't do it .
we can not let that happen .
you know in the old days , i would have said 100 years ago , 50 years ago , 30 years ago , pull out and let them fight each other .
here we are in syria .
we 're fighting people that want to _UNK_ syria .
think of this .
we 're fighting isis , but isis wants to _UNK_ the government .
maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains , okay .
but think of it ; think of it .
isis is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them , but we want syria to fall .
there are so many things ; there are so many things .
but the one game _UNK_ that we have to be careful with , that we never really had to think about too much before , other than a _UNK_ number of years ago , is the nuclear .
nuclear today , it 's not like soldiers in _UNK_ shooting _UNK_ .
you can take out the east coast of this country , you can take out large _UNK_ of the _UNK_ , you can take out things that were unthinkable .
the power .
and we have to be in a position where that never , ever , ever , every happens .
we 've never had this before .
we have a situation in afghanistan ; we 're spending tremendous amounts of money there .
we 're trying to do the right thing .
we have leadership , again -- no leadership respects us .
you know , leadership of other places never respect _UNK_ people , okay , that 's one thing you 're going to find .
the same thing is happening there .
and i never knew that afghanistan until a year ago or so , afghanistan has tremendous wealth in _UNK_ , different , not the oil , but _UNK_ .
and we 're fighting here , and on the other side of the mountain china is taking out all the _UNK_ .
they 're taking it out .
trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of _UNK_ .
so we 're fighting here and they are taking it out , looking at us and saying thank you very much _UNK_ .
it 's really , really _UNK_ .
so we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country .
if we do n't -- the other day in ohio a bridge collapsed .
bridges are _UNK_ all over the country .
the reports on bridges and the like are _UNK_ , what 's happening with our infrastructure .
i go to saudi arabia , i go to _UNK_ ; i am doing big jobs in _UNK_ .
i go to various different places .
i go to china .
they are building a bridge on every corner .
they have bridges that make the george washington bridge like small time stuff .
they 're building the most incredible things you have ever seen .
they are building airports in _UNK_ -- which they like to say `` _UNK_ '' but i 've always said `` _UNK_ '' so i 'll keep it `` _UNK_ '' what the hell .
but they 're building , they 're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen , in _UNK_ an airport the likes of which you have never seen .
and then i come back to _UNK_ where the _UNK_ have _UNK_ .
the place is falling apart .
you go into the main _UNK_ and they have a _UNK_ floor that 's so old it 's falling apart .
and they have a hole in it , and they replace it with _UNK_ .
so you have a white _UNK_ floor and they put _UNK_ all over the place .
this is inside , not outside .
and i just left _UNK_ where they have the most incredible thing you 've ever seen .
in fact my _UNK_ said oh mr. trump this is such an honor .
i said it 's not an honor ; they 're just smart .
but you look at _UNK_ , and you look at kennedy airport , and you look at our airports generally , you look at our _UNK_ where they 're crumbling .
you look at all of the things that are bad -- i 'll give you an example .
and this is n't part of what i was going to say , but i ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard _UNK_ .
you know the guard _UNK_ .
the ones that sort of go like this [ demonstrates with hand ] that are always bent , _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
did you ever see more than like 20 feet which is n't _UNK_ , or bent or the heat , if it gets too _UNK_ , it just _UNK_ .
now they 've been selling this thing for 25 years .
why does n't someone stop them and get something that works .
because they do n't know ; they do n't know what 's happening .
somebody made a lot of money on that .
they do n't know what is happening .
so we have to make our country great again .
we have to rebuild our country .
and we have a long way to go .
we are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money .
now we owe it to the chinese , a lot of it .
we owe it to other countries .
they 're the ones that hold the debt .
and then we give them money .
we have countries that we owe money to and yet we 're giving them subsidies .
i just ordered thousands of television sets and between _UNK_ and _UNK_ and i mean you know -- no american company comes to see and comes to _UNK_ .
it 's south korea , and whenever they have a problem we send the _UNK_ , we send the _UNK_ , we send our _UNK_ , we 're going to protect them .
what are we doing ; why are n't they paying us ?
why are n't they paying us ; what are we doing ?
i order thousands and thousands of sets all the time , for some reason it 's south korea .
you know whether it 's china , south korea , but in this case _UNK_ , south korea .
why are n't they doing something to justify what is going on ?
now , we have a very important election coming up .
we have a presidential election coming up .
and we have some good people .
nobody like trump of course , but these are minor details .
we have some good people .
it ' ca n't be mitt because mitt ran and failed .
he failed .
i mean i liked him .
look -- like him , _UNK_ him -- the _UNK_ % statement that he made , that 's not going away .
the _UNK_ from massachusetts , that 's not going away .
what do you think they 're going to say oh we wo n't bring that up this time .
it 's not fair because it was a long _UNK_ -- that does n't work .
but more importantly , he _UNK_ .
something happened to him in the last month .
he had that election won .
and let me tell you something .
that election , sort of like a _UNK_ that ca n't close the deal .
i know many of those guys ; they get it up to the _UNK_ line , they go _UNK_ , _UNK_ i ca n't close it .
or a _UNK_ that ca n't _UNK_ the _UNK_ to win the _UNK_ .
and there are many of them .
most people are like that ; i mean most people are like that .
you ca n't give somebody another chance , _UNK_ actually i think this election is tougher to win than _UNK_ a failed president .
i really do .
i think _UNK_ obama would have been a much easier one than the one that 's coming up , which is _UNK_ to say but true .
so you ca n't have romney .
he _UNK_ .
you ca n't have bush .
the last thing we need is another bush .
now i made that statement very strongly , and now every one says the last thing -- you know they _UNK_ it .
i 'll be accused of _UNK_ the statement ; that 's the bad thing .
but i said it .
i was the one that said it first , and i mean it .
the last thing we need is another bush .
now , he 's _UNK_ in favor of common core ; that 's a disaster , that 's bad , it should be local and all of that .
but he 's _UNK_ in favor of common core .
he 's very , very weak on immigration .
do n't forget -- remember his statement -- they come for love .
i say , what ?
come for love ?
you 've got these people coming , half of them are criminals .
they 're coming for love ?
they 're coming for a lot of other reasons , and it 's not love .
and when he runs , you got to remember his brother really gave us obama .
i was never a big fan , but his brother gave us obama .
_UNK_ abraham lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in _UNK_ that last couple of months .
and then he appointed justice _UNK_ .
and _UNK_ wanted justice _UNK_ .
and justice _UNK_ basically approved obamacare in a _UNK_ decision that nobody believes .
so you ca n't have _UNK_ bush .
and he 's going to lose aside from that ; he 's not going to win .
so mitt and -- you just ca n't have those two .
that 's it .
that 's it .
it 's so simple .
so just in _UNK_ up and i just wrote a few of these little points down because it 's very important .
and i watch these _UNK_ , and by the way i think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a _UNK_ , because we got one that uses _UNK_ .
and people say , oh he is so quick on his feet .
he is reading it .
i mean give me a break .
everything is read .
you do n't really test the _UNK_ of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk .
and that 's what we ended up getting -- the king of _UNK_ .
but , so when i look at these things here i say you know what , it 's so much easier , it would be so nice , just _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
no problems , get off stage , everybody falls _UNK_ and that 's the end of that .
but we have to do something about these _UNK_ .
but in looking at these situations -- i built an incredible company .
and you 'll see that .
an incredible company ; a wonderful company .
i employ thousands of people and i love doing what i 'm doing .
and in a certain way , i wish i were n't doing this , but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix .
we have such great potential .
so if i run for president and if i win , i would _UNK_ succeed in : creating jobs ; defeating isis and stopping the islamic terrorists -- and you have to do that ; reducing the budget deficit -- so important , have to do it ; securing our southern border -- and i mean seriously securing it ; stopping nuclear weapons in iran and elsewhere ; saving social security , medicare and medicaid , without cutting it down to the _UNK_ because it 's not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and it 's not fair to future people coming up , and we can do it ; _UNK_ obamacare and _UNK_ it with something far better for the people , and far less expensive , both for the people and for the country .
and believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody .
and everybody can be covered .
i 'm not saying leave _UNK_ of the people out .
everybody can be _UNK_ -- this plan is just a basic disaster .
nobody knows .
as bad as the website was , this is how bad the plan itself is ; fixing our country 's infrastructure , our bridges , our schools , our highways , our airports .
and that , i can tell you , nobody is close to trump .
i just got the best _UNK_ in north america .
i 'm building , which is sort of interesting , think of this one .
i 'm building one of the great _UNK_ of the world on pennsylvania avenue , right opposite the white house , between the white house and congress .
right on _UNK_ -- the old post office site , and i got it from obama .
do you believe that ?
and everybody wanted it .
so , i ca n't believe it myself .
but it 's going to be _UNK_ ; and so many other things .
i know what needs to be done to make america great again .
we can make this country great again .
the potential is enormous .
and i am serious thinking of running for president because i can do the job .
thank you all very much .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you very much , everybody .
thank you .
beautiful .
thank you .
speech 2 thank you for the opportunity to speak to you , and thank you to the center for national interest for honoring me with this _UNK_ .
it truly is a great honor .
i’d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country , one that _UNK_ _UNK_ with purpose , ideology with strategy , and chaos with peace .
it’s time to shake the _UNK_ off america’s foreign policy .
it’s time to invite new voices and new _UNK_ into the _UNK_ , something we have to do .
the direction i will _UNK_ today will also return us to a timeless principle .
my foreign policy will always put the interests of the american people and american security above all else .
it has to be first .
has to be .
that will be the foundation of every single decision that i will make .
america first will be the major and _UNK_ _UNK_ of my administration .
but to chart our path forward , we must first briefly take a look back .
we have a lot to be proud of .
in the _UNK_ we saved the world .
the greatest generation beat back the _UNK_ and japanese _UNK_ .
then we saved the world again .
this time , from _UNK_ and communism .
the cold war _UNK_ for decades but , guess what , we won and we won big .
democrats and republicans working together got mr. _UNK_ to heed the words of president reagan , our great president , when he said , tear down this wall .
history will not forget what he did .
a very special man and president .
unfortunately , after the cold war our foreign policy _UNK_ badly off course .
we failed to develop a new vision for a new time .
in fact , as time went on , our foreign policy began to make less and less sense .
logic was replaced with _UNK_ and _UNK_ , which led to one foreign policy disaster after another .
they just kept coming and coming .
we went from mistakes in iraq to egypt to libya , to president _UNK_ line in the sand in syria .
each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave isis the space it needs to grow and prosper .
very bad .
it all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy .
we _UNK_ up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed .
civil war , religious _UNK_ , thousands of americans and just killed be lives , lives , lives wasted .
_UNK_ wasted .
many trillions of dollars were lost as a result .
the vacuum was created that isis would fill .
iran , too , would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust _UNK_ .
they have benefited so much , so sadly , for us .
our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster .
no vision .
no purpose .
no direction .
no strategy .
today i want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy .
first , our resources are _UNK_ over extended .
president obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy .
he’s crippled us with wasteful spending , massive debt , low growth , a huge trade deficit and open borders .
our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $ 1 trillion a year .
we’re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own .
ending the theft of american jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military , which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength .
i am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem .
i’m the only one _UNK_ believe me , i know them all , i’m the only one who knows how to fix it .
_UNK_ , our allies are not paying their fair share , and i’ve been talking about this recently a lot .
our allies must contribute toward their financial , political , and human costs , have to do it , of our tremendous security burden .
but many of them are simply not doing so .
they look at the united states as weak and _UNK_ and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us .
in nato , for instance , only 4 of _UNK_ other member countries _UNK_ america , are spending the minimum required 2 percent of _UNK_ on defense .
we have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes , missiles , ships , equipment , building up our military to provide a strong defense for europe and asia .
the countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense , and if not , the u.s. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves .
we have no choice .
the whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security .
a trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded , and funded _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , our friends are beginning to think they can’t depend on us .
we’ve had a president who _UNK_ our friends and _UNK_ to our enemies , something that we’ve never seen before in the history of our country .
he negotiated a disastrous deal with iran , and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the _UNK_ was dry .
iran can not be allowed to have a nuclear weapon , can not be allowed .
remember that , can not be allowed to have a nuclear weapon .
and under a trump administration , will never , ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon .
all of this without even _UNK_ the _UNK_ of the united states with iran’s treatment of our ten captured sailors _UNK_ so _UNK_ i remember that day .
in negotiation , you must be willing to walk .
the iran deal , like so many of our worst agreements , is the result of not being willing to leave the table .
when the other side knows you’re not going to walk , it becomes absolutely impossible to win _UNK_ you just can’t win .
at the same time , your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them .
you’ve made that agreement , you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place .
president obama _UNK_ our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with poland and the czech republic .
he supported the _UNK_ of a friendly regime in egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with israel , and then helped bring the muslim brotherhood to power in its place .
israel , our great friend and the one true democracy in the middle east has been _UNK_ and _UNK_ by an administration that _UNK_ moral clarity .
just a few days ago , vice president biden again _UNK_ israel , a force for justice and peace , for acting as an _UNK_ peace area in the region .
president obama has not been a friend to israel .
he has treated iran with _UNK_ love and care and made it a great power .
iran has , indeed , become a great , great power in just a very short period of time , because of what we’ve done .
all of the expense and all at the expense of israel , our allies in the region and very importantly , the united states itself .
we’ve picked fights with our oldest friends , and now they’re starting to look elsewhere for help .
remember that .
not good .
fourth , our _UNK_ no longer respect us .
in fact , they’re just as _UNK_ as our allies , but in an even bigger problem is they don’t take us seriously anymore .
the truth is they don’t respect us .
when president obama landed in cuba on air force one , no leader was there , nobody , to _UNK_ him .
perhaps an incident without _UNK_ in the long and _UNK_ history of air force one .
then _UNK_ , the same thing happened in saudi arabia .
it’s called no respect .
absolutely no respect .
do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to copenhagen , _UNK_ , to get the _UNK_ for our country , and after this unprecedented effort , it was announced that the united states came in fourth _UNK_ fourth place ?
the president of the united states making this trip _UNK_ unprecedented _UNK_ comes in fourth place .
he should have known the result before making such an _UNK_ commitment .
we were _UNK_ at all over the world , as we have been many , many times .
the list of _UNK_ go on and on and on .
president obama _UNK_ _UNK_ as north korea increases its aggression and _UNK_ further and further with its nuclear reach .
our president has allowed china to continue its economic assault on american jobs and wealth , refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on china necessary to rein in north korea .
we have the leverage .
we have the power over china , economic power , and people don’t understand it .
and with that economic power , we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with north korea , which is _UNK_ out of control .
he has even allowed china to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial _UNK_ against the united states and its companies .
we’ve let our _UNK_ and _UNK_ think they can get away with anything , and they do .
they do at will .
it always happens .
if president _UNK_ goal had been to weaken america , he could not have done a better job .
finally , america no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals .
since the end of the cold war and the _UNK_ of the soviet union , we’ve _UNK_ a _UNK_ foreign policy .
one day , we’re bombing libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians .
the next day , we’re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart .
lives lost , massive _UNK_ lost .
the world is a different place .
we’re a humanitarian nation , but the legacy of the _UNK_ _UNK_ will be weakness , _UNK_ and _UNK_ , a mess .
we’ve made the middle east more unstable and _UNK_ than ever before .
we left christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide .
we have done nothing to help the christians , nothing , and we should always be _UNK_ for that , for that lack of action .
our actions in iraq , libya and syria have helped unleash isis , and we’re in a war against radical islam , but president obama won’t even name the enemy , and unless you name the enemy , you will never ever solve the problem .
hillary clinton also refuses to say the words radical islam , even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country .
after secretary _UNK_ failed intervention in libya , islamic terrorists in benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave americans .
then , instead of taking charge that night , hillary clinton decided to go home and sleep .
incredible .
clinton _UNK_ it all on a video , an excuse that was a total lie , proven to be absolutely a total lie .
our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state _UNK_ the nation .
and , by the way , she was not _UNK_ to take that call at 3 _UNK_ in the morning .
and now isis is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling libya oil .
and you know what ?
we don’t _UNK_ , we don’t bomb , we don’t do anything about it .
it’s almost as if our country doesn’t even know what’s happening , which could be a fact and could be true .
this will all change when i become president .
to our friends and allies , i say america is going to be strong again .
america is going to be reliable again .
it’s going to be a great and reliable ally again .
it’s going to be a friend again .
we’re going to finally have a _UNK_ foreign policy based upon american interests and the shared interests of our allies .
we’re getting out of the _UNK_ business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world .
our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the _UNK_ edge .
we need a new rational american foreign policy , informed by the best minds and supported by both parties , and it will be by both parties _UNK_ democrats , republicans , independents , everybody , as well as by our close allies .
this is how we won the cold war and it’s how we will win our new future struggles , which may be many , which may be complex , but we will win if i become president .
first , we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical islam .
_UNK_ the spread of radical islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the united states and indeed the world .
events may require the use of military force , but it’s also a _UNK_ struggle , like our long struggle in the cold war .
in this , we’re going to be working very closely with our allies in the muslim world , all of which are at risk from radical islamic violence , attacks and everything else .
it is a dangerous world , more dangerous now than it has ever been .
we should work _UNK_ thank you .
we should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical islam .
but this has to be a _UNK_ street .
they must also be good to us .
remember that .
they have to be good to us , no longer one way .
it’s now _UNK_ .
and remember , us and all we’re doing , they have to appreciate what we’ve done to them .
we’re going to help , but they have to appreciate what we’ve done for them .
the struggle against radical islam also takes place in our homeland .
there are scores of recent _UNK_ inside our borders charged with terrorism .
for every case known to the public , there are dozens and dozens more .
we must stop _UNK_ extremism through senseless immigration policies .
we have no idea where these people are coming from .
there’s no _UNK_ .
there’s no _UNK_ .
there’s nothing .
we have to be smart .
we have to be vigilant .
a pause for _UNK_ will help us to prevent the next san _UNK_ or frankly , much worse .
all you have to do is look at the world trade center and september 11th , one of the great _UNK_ , in my opinion , the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country ; worse than pearl harbor because you take a look at what’s happened , and citizens were attacked , as opposed to the military being attacked _UNK_ one of the true great _UNK_ .
and then there’s isis .
i have a simple message for them .
their days are _UNK_ .
i won’t tell them where and i won’t tell them how .
we must ... ... we must as a nation be more _UNK_ .
we are _UNK_ _UNK_ .
we tell everything .
we’re sending troops .
we tell them .
we’re sending something else .
we have a news conference .
we have to be _UNK_ .
and we have to be _UNK_ starting now .
but they’re going to be gone .
isis will be gone if i’m elected president .
and they’ll be gone quickly .
they will be gone very , very quickly .
_UNK_ , we have to rebuild our military and our economy .
the russians and chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability , but look at what’s happened to us .
our nuclear weapons arsenal , our ultimate _UNK_ , has been allowed to _UNK_ and is desperately in need of _UNK_ and renewal .
and it has to happen immediately .
our active duty armed forces have _UNK_ from 2 million in _UNK_ to about 1.3 million today .
the navy has _UNK_ from over 500 ships to _UNK_ ships during this same period of time .
the air force is about one-third smaller than _UNK_ pilots flying _UNK_ in combat missions today .
these planes are older than virtually everybody in this room .
and what are we doing about this ?
president obama has proposed a _UNK_ defense budget that in real dollars , cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011. our military is _UNK_ and we’re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming .
we will spend what we need to rebuild our military .
it is the cheapest , single investment we can make .
we will develop , build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind .
our military _UNK_ must be _UNK_ , and i mean _UNK_ , by anybody and everybody .
but we will look for savings and spend our money wisely .
in this time of mounting debt , right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem .
but i do .
no one dollar can be wasted .
not one single dollar can we waste .
we’re also going to have to change our trade , immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again .
and to put americans first again .
this will ensure that our own workers , right here in america , get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues , increase our economic might as a nation , make us strong _UNK_ again .
so , so important .
we need to think smart about areas where our technological _UNK_ , and nobody comes close , gives us an edge .
this includes _UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ intelligence and cyber warfare .
a great country also takes care of its warriors .
our commitment to them is absolute , and i mean absolute .
a trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve .
and the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life .
our veterans ... our veterans have not been treated fairly or _UNK_ .
these are our great people and we must treat them fairly .
we must even treat them really , really well and that will happen under the trump administration .
finally , we must develop a foreign policy based on american interests .
businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries .
look at what happened in the 1990s .
our embassies in kenya and _UNK_ _UNK_ and this was a _UNK_ time for us _UNK_ were attacked .
and 17 brave sailors were killed on the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
and what did we do ?
it seemed we put more effort into adding china into the world trade organization , which has been a total disaster for the united states .
frankly , we spent more time on that than we did in stopping al qaeda .
we even had an opportunity to take out osama bin laden and we didn’t do it and then we got hit at the world trade center and the pentagon .
again , the worst attack on our country in its history .
our foreign policy goals must be based on america’s core national security interests .
and the following will be my priorities .
in the middle east our goals must be , and i mean must be , to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability , not radical change .
we need to be _UNK_ about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies .
and believe me , we have groups that no matter what you do , they will be the enemy .
: we have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are , who those people are , and not help them .
and we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends .
we desire to live peacefully and in friendship with russia and china .
we have serious differences with these two nations , and must regard them with open eyes , but we are not bound to be adversaries .
we should seek common ground based on shared interests .
russia , for instance , has also seen the horror of islamic terrorism .
i believe an _UNK_ of tensions , and improved relations with russia from a position of strength only is possible , absolutely possible .
common sense says this cycle , this _UNK_ cycle of hostility must end and _UNK_ will end soon .
good for both countries .
some say the russians won’t be reasonable .
i intend to find out .
if we can’t make a deal under my administration , a deal that’s great _UNK_ not good , great _UNK_ for america , but also good for russia , then we will quickly walk from the table .
it’s as simple as that .
we’re going to find out .
fixing our relations with china is another important step _UNK_ and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time .
china respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically , which they are doing like never before , we have lost all of their respect .
we have a massive trade deficit with china , a deficit that we have to find a way quickly , and i mean quickly , to balance .
a strong and smart america is an america that will find a better friend in china , better than we have right now .
look at what china is doing in the south china sea .
they’re not supposed to be doing it .
no respect for this country or this president .
we can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways .
if need be , that’s what’s going to have to happen .
after i’m elected president , i will also call for a summit with our nato allies and a separate summit with our asian allies .
in these _UNK_ , we will not only discuss a _UNK_ of financial commitments , but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges .
for instance , we will discuss how we can upgrade _UNK_ outdated mission and structure , grown out of the cold war to confront our shared challenges , including _UNK_ and islamic terrorism .
i will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative .
but if america fights , it must only fight to win .
i will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary , and i mean absolutely necessary , and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital _UNK_ our goal is peace and prosperity , not war and destruction .
the best way to achieve those goals is through a _UNK_ , _UNK_ and consistent foreign policy .
with president obama and secretary clinton we’ve had the _UNK_ opposite _UNK_ a reckless , _UNK_ and _UNK_ foreign policy , one that has _UNK_ the path of destruction in its wake .
after losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars , we are in far worst shape in the middle east than ever , ever before .
i challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of _UNK_ .
it has been a complete and total disaster .
i will also be prepared to deploy america’s economic resources .
financial leverage and sanctions can be very , very _UNK_ , but we need to use them _UNK_ and with total determination .
our power will be used if others do not play by the rules .
in other words , if they do not treat us fairly .
our friends and enemies must know that if i draw a line in the sand , i will enforce that line in the sand .
believe me .
however , unlike other candidates for the presidency , war and aggression will not be my first instinct .
you can not have a foreign policy without diplomacy .
a superpower understands that _UNK_ and restraint are really truly signs of strength .
although not in government service , i was _UNK_ against the war in iraq , very proudly , saying for many years that it would _UNK_ the middle east .
sadly , i was correct , and the biggest _UNK_ has been has been iran , who is _UNK_ taking over iraq and _UNK_ access to their very rich oil reserves , something it has wanted to do for decades .
and now , to top it off , we have isis .
my goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations .
that’s why i also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas , rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect _UNK_ but very little to _UNK_ about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war .
we have to look to new people .
we have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don’t know what they’re doing , even though they may look _UNK_ good writing in the new york times or being watched on television .
finally , i will work with our allies to _UNK_ western values and institutions .
instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants , we should understand that strengthening and promoting western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military _UNK_ .
these are my goals as president .
i will seek a foreign policy that all americans , whatever their party , can support , so important , and which our friends and allies will respect and _UNK_ welcome .
the world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies , that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies , that’s what we want .
we want them to be our allies .
we want the world to be _UNK_ we want to bring peace to the world .
too much destruction out there , too many destructive weapons .
the power of _UNK_ is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world .
to achieve these goals , americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership .
again , many americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own .
americans .
americans must know that we’re putting the american people first again on trade .
so true .
on trade , on immigration , on foreign policy .
the jobs , incomes and security of the american worker will always be my first priority .
no country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first .
both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we , while being fair to them , must start doing the same .
we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of _UNK_ .
the _UNK_ remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony .
i am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring america down and will never enter .
and under my administration , we will never enter america into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs .
_UNK_ , as an example , has been a total disaster for the united states and has _UNK_ our states _UNK_ literally _UNK_ our states of our manufacturing and our jobs .
and i’ve just gotten to see it .
i’ve _UNK_ pennsylvania .
i’ve _UNK_ new york .
i’ve _UNK_ so many of the states .
they have been _UNK_ out .
their manufacturing is gone .
never again , only the reverse _UNK_ and i have to say this strongly _UNK_ never again ; only the reverse will happen .
we will keep our jobs and bring in new ones .
there will be consequences for the companies that leave the united states only to exploit it later .
they fire the people .
they take advantage of the united states .
there will be consequences for those companies .
never again .
under a trump administration , no american citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country .
i will view as president the world through the clear _UNK_ of american interests .
i will be america’s greatest _UNK_ and most loyal champion .
we will not apologize for becoming successful again , but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are .
the world is most peaceful and most prosperous when america is strongest .
america will continue and continue forever to play the role of _UNK_ .
we will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself , but to play the role , we must make america strong again .
and always _UNK_ always , always , we must make , and we have to look at it from every _UNK_ , and we have no choice , we must make america respected again .
we must make america truly wealthy again .
and we must _UNK_ we have to and we will make america great again .
and if we do that _UNK_ and if we do that , perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever , ever known .
thank you very much , everybody .
i appreciate it .
thank you .
speech 3 a hand with little fingers coming out of a stem .
like , little .
look at my hands .
they’re fine .
nobody other than _UNK_ _UNK_ years ago used to use that .
my hands are normal hands .
during a debate , he was losing , and he said , `` oh , he has small hands and therefore , you know what that means . ''
this was not me .
this was _UNK_ that said , `` he has small hands and you know what that means . ''
okay ?
so , he started it .
so , what i said a couple of days later ... and what happened is i was on line _UNK_ hands with supporters , and one of supporters got up and he said , `` mr. trump , you have strong hands .
you have _UNK_ hands . ''
and then another one would say , `` you have great hands , mr. trump , i had no idea . ''
i said , `` what do you mean ? ''
he said , `` i thought you were like _UNK_ , and i thought you had small hands . ''
i had fifty people ... is that a correct statement ?
i mean people were writing , `` how are mr. _UNK_ hands ? ''
my hands are fine .
you know , my hands are normal .
slightly large , actually .
in fact , i buy a slightly smaller than large _UNK_ , okay ?
no , but i did this because everybody was saying to me , `` oh , your hands are very nice .
they are normal . ''
so _UNK_ , in a debate , said , because he had nothing else to say ... now i was hitting him pretty hard .
he wanted to do his _UNK_ _UNK_ stuff and it didn’t work out .
obviously , it didn’t work too well .
but one of the things he said was `` he has small hands and therefore , you know what that means , he has small something else . ''
you can look it up .
i didn’t say it .
i don’t want people to go around thinking that i have a problem .
i’m telling you , _UNK_ , i had so many people .
i would say 25 , 30 people would tell me ... every time i’d shake people’s hand , `` oh , you have nice hands . ''
why shouldn’t i ?
and , by the way , by saying that i solved the problem .
nobody questions ... i even held up my hands , and said , `` look , take a look at that hand . ''
i don’t know if it was presidential , honestly , whether it is or not .
he said , _UNK_ trump has small hands and therefore he has small something _UNK_ i didn’t say that .
and all i did is when he failed , when he was failing , when he was , when _UNK_ made him look bad , i gave him _UNK_ a little _UNK_ and i said , and i said , and i had this big strong powerful hand ready to _UNK_ him , because i thought he was going to _UNK_ .
and everybody took it fine .
whether it was presidential or not i can’t tell you .
i can just say that what he said was a lie .
and everybody , they wanted to do stories on my hands ; after i said that , they never did .
and then i held up the hand , i showed people the hand .
you know , when i’ve got a big audience .
so yeah , i think it’s not a question of presidential ... speech 4 oh boy .
we love nevada .
we love nevada .
thank you .
thank you .
oh this is a great place .
thank you very much .
great evening .
we will be celebrating for a long time tonight .
have a good time .
have a good time .
you know we weren’t _UNK_ couple of months ago , we weren’t expecting to win this one , you know that , right ?
we weren’t .
of course if you listen to the pundits , we weren’t expected to win too much , and now we’re winning , winning , winning the country .
and soon the country’s going to start winning , winning , winning .
so i want to thank the volunteers .
they’ve been _UNK_ .
these people , they work like _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
we’re not going to forget it .
and we’ve had some great numbers coming out of texas , and amazing numbers coming out of tennessee and georgia and _UNK_ and then in a couple of weeks later florida .

we’re _UNK_ the governor .
it’s always nice to be _UNK_ the governor .
and _UNK_ whole thing .

we might not even need the two months , folks , to be honest .
so tonight we had 45 to _UNK_ % , and tomorrow you’d hear them say , you know , if they could just take the other candidates and add them up , and if you could add them up because you know the other candidates amount to 55 % .
so if they _UNK_ keep _UNK_ that when people drop out , we’re going to get a lot of votes .
you know they keep _UNK_ .

speech 5 _UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
that is some group of people .
thousands .
so nice , thank you very much .
that’s really nice .
thank you .
it’s great to be at trump tower .
it’s great to be in a wonderful city , new york .
and it’s an honor to have everybody here .
this is beyond _UNK_ expectations .
there’s been no crowd like this .
and , i can tell , some of the candidates , they went in .
they didn’t know the _UNK_ didn’t work .
they _UNK_ like _UNK_ .
they didn’t know the room was too big , because they didn’t have anybody there .
how are they going to beat isis ?
i don’t think it’s _UNK_ _UNK_ happen .
our country is in serious trouble .
we don’t have victories anymore .
we used to have victories , but we don’t have them .
when was the last time anybody saw us _UNK_ , let’s say , china in a trade deal ?
they kill us .
i beat china all the time .
all the time .
when did we beat japan at anything ?
they send their cars over by the millions , and what do we do ?
when was the last time you saw a _UNK_ in _UNK_ ?
it doesn’t exist , folks .
they beat us all the time .
when do we beat mexico at the border ?
they’re _UNK_ at us , at our _UNK_ .
and now they are _UNK_ us economically .
they are not our friend , believe me .
but they’re killing us economically .
the u.s. has become a _UNK_ ground for everybody else’s problems .
speech 6 thank you .
it’s true , and these are the best and the finest .
when mexico sends its people , they’re not sending their best .
they’re not sending you .
they’re not sending you .
they’re sending people that have _UNK_ of problems , and they’re bringing those problems with us .
they’re bringing drugs .
they’re bringing crime .
they’re _UNK_ .
and some , i assume , are good people .
oh and it only makes common sense .
it only makes common sense .
they’re sending us not the right people .
it’s coming from more than mexico .
it’s coming from all over south and latin america , and it’s coming probably _UNK_ probably _UNK_ from the middle east .
but we don’t know .
because we have no protection and we have no _UNK_ , we don’t know what’s happening .
and it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast .
islamic terrorism is eating up large _UNK_ of the middle east .
they’ve become rich .
i’m in competition with them .
they just built a _UNK_ in syria .
can you believe this ?
they built a _UNK_ .
when i have to build a _UNK_ , i pay interest .
they don’t have to pay interest , because they took the oil that , when we left iraq , i said we _UNK_ taken .
so now isis has the oil , and what they don’t have , iran has .
and in 19 _UNK_ and i will tell you this , and i said it very strongly , years ago , i said _UNK_ and i love the military , and i want to have the strongest military that we’ve ever had , and we need it more now than ever .
but i said , `` don’t hit iraq , '' because you’re going to _UNK_ _UNK_ the middle east .
iran is going to take over the middle east , iran and somebody else will get the oil , and it turned out that iran is now taking over iraq .
think of it .
iran is taking over iraq , and they’re taking it over big league .
we spent $ 2 trillion in iraq , $ 2 trillion .
we lost thousands of lives , thousands in iraq .
we have wounded soldiers , who i love , i love _UNK_ they’re great _UNK_ all over the place , thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers .
and we have nothing .
we can’t even go there .
we have nothing .
and every time we give iraq equipment , the first time a bullet goes off in the air , they leave it .
last week , i read _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ these are big vehicles _UNK_ were left behind for the enemy .
2,000 ?
you would say maybe two , maybe four ?
_UNK_ sophisticated vehicles , they ran , and the enemy took them .
last quarter , it was just announced our gross domestic product _UNK_ a sign of strength , right ?
but not for us .
it was below zero .
whoever heard of this ?
it’s never below zero .
our labor participation rate was the worst since _UNK_ but think of it , _UNK_ below zero , _UNK_ labor participation rate .
and our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent .
don’t believe the _UNK_ don’t believe it .
that’s right .
a lot of people up there can’t get jobs .
they can’t get jobs , because there are no jobs , because china has our jobs and mexico has our jobs .
they all have jobs .
but the real number , the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even _UNK_ percent , and nobody talks about it , because it’s a statistic that’s full of _UNK_ .
our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way , and we as a country are getting weaker .
even our nuclear arsenal doesn’t work .
it came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old .
they don’t know if it worked .
and i thought it was _UNK_ when it was _UNK_ on television , because boy , does that send signals to putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say , `` that is a group of people , and that is a nation that truly has no _UNK_ .
they don’t know what they’re doing .
they don’t know what they’re doing . ''
we have a disaster called the big lie : obamacare .
obamacare .
yesterday , it came out that costs are going for people up 29 , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , and even 55 percent , and _UNK_ are through the roof .
you have to be hit by a _UNK_ , literally , a _UNK_ , to use it , because the _UNK_ are so high , it’s virtually _UNK_ .
it’s virtually _UNK_ .
it is a _UNK_ : and remember the $ 5 billion web site ?
$ 5 billion we spent on a web site , and to this day it doesn’t work .
a $ 5 billion web site .
if and when the _UNK_ is attacked by isis , which as everyone knows is _UNK_ ultimate _UNK_ , i can promise you that the pope would have only _UNK_ and prayed that donald trump would have been president because this would not have happened .
isis would have been _UNK_ unlike what is happening now with our all talk , no action politicians .
the mexican government and its leadership has made many _UNK_ remarks about me to the pope , because they want to continue to _UNK_ off the united states , both on trade and at the border , and they understand i am _UNK_ wise to them .
the pope only heard one side of the story - he didn’t see the crime , the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the united states .
he doesn’t see how mexican leadership is _UNK_ president obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation .
for a religious leader to question a _UNK_ faith is _UNK_ .
i am proud to be a christian and as president i will not allow _UNK_ to be consistently attacked and weakened , unlike what is happening now , with our current president .
no leader , especially a religious leader , should have the right to question another man’s religion or faith .
they are using the pope as a _UNK_ and they should be _UNK_ of themselves for doing so , especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so _UNK_ .
i have so many web sites , i have them all over the place .
i hire people , they do a web site .
it costs me $ 3 .
$ 5 billion web site .
well , you need somebody , because politicians are all talk , no action .
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ get done .
they will not bring us _UNK_ believe me _UNK_ to the promised land .
they will not .
as an example , i’ve been on the _UNK_ making speeches , and i hear my fellow republicans .
and they’re wonderful people .
i like them .
they all want me to support them .
they don’t know how to bring it about .
they come up to my office .
i’m meeting with three of them in the next week .
and they don’t know _UNK_ `` are you running ?
are you not running ?
could we have your support ?
what do we do ?
how do we do it ? ''
i like them .
and i hear their speeches .
and they don’t talk jobs and they don’t talk china .
when was the last time you heard china is killing us ?
they’re _UNK_ their currency to a level that you wouldn’t believe .
it makes it impossible for our companies to compete , impossible .
they’re killing us .
but you don’t hear that from anybody else .
you don’t hear it from anybody else .
and i watch the speeches .
thank you .
i watch the speeches of these people , and they say the sun will rise , the moon will set , all sorts of wonderful things will happen .
and people are saying , `` what’s going on ?
i just want a job .
just get me a job .
i don’t need the rhetoric .
i want a job . ''
and that’s what’s happening .
and it’s going to get worse , because remember , obamacare really _UNK_ in in _UNK_ , _UNK_ obama is going to be out playing _UNK_ .
he might be on one of my courses .
i would invite him , i actually would say .
i have the best courses in the world , so i’d say , you what , if he wants to _UNK_ i have one right next to the white house , right on the _UNK_ .
if he’d like to play , that’s fine .
in fact , i’d love him to leave early and play , that would be a very good thing .
but obamacare _UNK_ in in _UNK_ really big league .
it is going to be _UNK_ destructive .
doctors are quitting .
i have a friend who’s a doctor , and he said to me the other day , `` donald , i never saw anything like it .
i have more accountants than i have nurses .
it’s a disaster .
my patients are beside themselves .
they had a plan that was good .
they have no plan now . ''
we have to repeal obamacare , and it can be _UNK_ and _UNK_ and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody .
let it be for everybody .
but much better and much less expensive for people and for the government .
and we can do it .
so i’ve watched the politicians .
i’ve dealt with them all my life .
if you can’t make a good deal with a politician , then there’s something wrong with you .
you’re certainly not very good .
and that’s what we _UNK_ _UNK_ us .
they will never make america great again .
they don’t even have a chance .
they’re controlled fully _UNK_ they’re controlled fully by the lobbyists , by the _UNK_ , and by the special interests , fully .
yes , they control them .
hey , i have lobbyists .
i have to tell you .
i have lobbyists that can produce anything for me .
they’re great .
but you know what ?
it won’t happen .
it won’t happen .
because we have to stop doing things for some people , but for this country , it’s destroying our country .
we have to stop , and it has to stop now .
we need a leader that can bring back our jobs , can bring back our manufacturing , can bring back our military , can take care of our vets .
our vets have been abandoned .
and we also need a _UNK_ .
you know , when president obama was elected , i said , `` well , the one thing , i think he’ll do well .
i think he’ll be a great _UNK_ for the country .
i think he’d be a great spirit . ''
he was vibrant .
he was young .
i really thought that he would be a great _UNK_ .
he’s not a leader .
that’s true .
you’re right about that .
but he wasn’t a _UNK_ .
he’s actually a negative force .
he’s been a negative force .
he wasn’t a _UNK_ ; he was the opposite .
we need somebody that can take the brand of the united states and make it great again .
it’s not great again .
we need _UNK_ we need somebody _UNK_ we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again .
we can do that .
and , i will tell you , i love my life .
i have a wonderful family .
they’re saying , `` dad , you’re going to do something that’s going to be so tough . ''
you know , all of my life , i’ve heard that a truly successful person , a really , really successful person and even _UNK_ successful can not run for public office .
just can’t happen .
and yet that’s the kind of _UNK_ that you need to make this country great again .
so ladies and gentlemen ... i am _UNK_ running ... ... for president of the united states , and we are going to make our country great again .
it can happen .
our country has tremendous potential .
we have tremendous people .
we have people that aren’t working .
we have people that have no incentive to work .
but they’re going to have incentive to work , because the greatest social program is a job .
and they’ll be proud , and they’ll love it , and they’ll make much more than they _UNK_ ever made , and they’ll be _UNK_ they’ll be doing so well , and we’re going to be thriving as a country , thriving .
it can happen .
i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created .
i tell you that .
i’ll bring back our jobs from china , from mexico , from japan , from so many places .
i’ll bring back our jobs , and i’ll bring back our money .
right now , think of this : we owe china $ 1.3 trillion .
we owe japan more than that .
so they come in , they take our jobs , they take our money , and then they loan us back the money , and we pay them in interest , and then the dollar goes up so their _UNK_ even better .
how _UNK_ are our leaders ?
how _UNK_ are these politicians to allow this to happen ?
how _UNK_ are they ?
i’m going to tell you _UNK_ thank you .
i’m going to tell you a couple of stories about trade , because i’m _UNK_ against the trade bill for a number of reasons .
number one , the people negotiating don’t have a _UNK_ .
our president doesn’t have a _UNK_ .
he’s a bad _UNK_ .
he’s the one that did _UNK_ .
we get _UNK_ , they get five _UNK_ terrorists that everybody wanted over there .
we get _UNK_ .
we get a _UNK_ .
we get a _UNK_ _UNK_ , and they get the five people that they wanted for years , and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us .
that’s the _UNK_ we have .
take a look at the deal he’s making with iran .
he makes that deal , israel maybe won’t exist very long .
it’s a disaster , and we have to protect israel .
but ... so we need people _UNK_ i’m a free _UNK_ .
but the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you .
if you don’t have talented people , if you don’t have great leadership , if you don’t have people that know business , not just a political _UNK_ that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign , which is the way all jobs , just about , are gotten , free trade terrible .
free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people , but we have people that are _UNK_ .
we have people that aren’t smart .
and we have people that are controlled by special interests .
and it’s just not going to work .
so , here’s a couple of stories happened recently .
a friend of mine is a great manufacturer .
and , you know , china comes over and they _UNK_ all their stuff , and i buy it .
i buy it , because , frankly , i have an obligation to buy it , because they _UNK_ their currency so _UNK_ , they just did it recently , and nobody thought they could do it again .
but with all our problems with russia , with all our problems with everything _UNK_ everything , they got away with it again .
and it’s impossible for our people here to compete .
so i want to tell you this story .
a friend of mine who’s a great manufacturer , calls me up a few weeks ago .
he’s very _UNK_ .
i said , `` what’s your problem ? ''
he said , `` you know , i make great product . ''
and i said , `` i know .
i know that because i buy the product . ''
he said , `` i can’t get it into china .
they won’t accept it .
i sent a boat over and they actually sent it back .
they talked about environmental , they talked about all sorts of _UNK_ that had nothing to do with it . ''
i said , `` oh , wait a minute , that’s terrible .
does anyone know this ? ''
he said , `` yeah , they do it all the time with other people . ''
i said , `` they send it back ? ''
`` yeah .
so i finally got it over there and they charged me a big _UNK_ .
they’re not supposed to be doing that .
i told them . ''
now , they do charge you _UNK_ on trucks , when we send trucks and other things over there .
ask _UNK_ .
they wanted _UNK_ secrets .
they wanted their _UNK_ and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from _UNK_ .
hey , i’m not saying they’re _UNK_ .
i like china .
i sell _UNK_ for _UNK_ i just sold an apartment for $ 15 million to somebody from china .
am i supposed to _UNK_ them ?
i own a big chunk of the bank of america building at _UNK_ avenue of the americas , that i got from china in a war .
very valuable .
i love china .
the biggest bank in the world is from china .
you know where their united states _UNK_ is _UNK_ ?
in this building , in trump tower .
i love china .
people say , `` oh , you don’t like china ? ''
no , i love them .
but their leaders are much smarter than our leaders , and we can’t sustain _UNK_ with that .
there’s too much _UNK_ it’s like _UNK_ it’s like take the new _UNK_ patriots and tom _UNK_ and have them play your high school football team .
that’s the difference between _UNK_ leaders and our leaders .
they are _UNK_ us .
we are rebuilding china .
we’re rebuilding many countries .
china , you go there now , roads , bridges , schools , you never saw anything like it .
they have bridges that make the george washington bridge look like small _UNK_ .
and they’re all over the place .
we have all the cards , but we don’t know how to use them .
we don’t even know that we have the cards , because our leaders don’t understand the game .
we could turn off that _UNK_ by charging them tax until they _UNK_ properly .
now they’re going _UNK_ .
they’re building a military island in the middle of the south china sea .
a military island .
now , our country could never do that because we’d have to get environmental _UNK_ , and the _UNK_ wouldn’t let our country _UNK_ we would never build in an ocean .
they built it in about one year , this massive military _UNK_ .
they’re building up their military to a point that is very _UNK_ .
you have a problem with isis .
you have a bigger problem with china .
and , in my opinion , the new china , believe it or not , in terms of trade , is mexico .
so this man tells me about the manufacturing .
i say , `` that’s a terrible story .
i hate to hear it . ''
but i have another one , ford .
so mexico takes a company , a car company that was going to build in tennessee , _UNK_ it out .
everybody thought the deal was dead .
reported it in the wall street _UNK_ recently .
everybody thought it was a done deal .
it’s going in and that’s going to be it , going into tennessee .
great state , great _UNK_ : all of a sudden , at the last moment , this big car manufacturer , foreign , _UNK_ they’re not going to tennessee .
they’re _UNK_ _UNK_ spend their $ 1 billion in mexico instead .
not good .
now , ford _UNK_ a few weeks ago that ford is going to build a $ 2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in mexico .
$ 2.5 billion , it’s going to be one of the largest in the world .
ford .
good company .
so i announced that i’m running for president .
i would ... ... one of the early things i would do , probably before i even got in _UNK_ and i wouldn’t even use _UNK_ you know , i have _UNK_ i know the _UNK_ negotiators in the world .
i know the good ones .
i know the bad ones .
i know the _UNK_ ones .
you get a lot of them that are _UNK_ .
they’re not good .
they think they are .
they get good stories , because the newspapers get _UNK_ ( _UNK_ ) .
but they’re not good .
but i know the negotiators in the world , and i put them one for each country .
believe me , folks .
we will do very , very well , very , very well .
but i wouldn’t even waste my time with this one .
i would call up the head of ford , who i know .
if i was president , i’d say , `` congratulations .
i understand that you’re building a nice $ 2.5 billion car factory in mexico and that you’re going to take your cars and sell them to the united states zero tax , just flow them across the border . ''
and you say to yourself , `` how does that help us , '' right ?
`` how does that help us ?
where is that good '' ?
it’s not .
so i would say , `` congratulations .
that’s the good news .
let me give you the bad news .
every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border , we’re going to charge you a _UNK_ tax , and that tax is going to be paid _UNK_ with the _UNK_ , and that’s it .
now , here’s what is going to happen .
if it’s not me in the position , it’s one of these politicians that we’re running against , you know , the 400 people that we’re ( inaudible ) .
and here’s what’s going to happen .
they’re not so _UNK_ .
they know it’s not a good thing , and they may even be _UNK_ by it .
but then they’re going to get a call from the _UNK_ or probably from the _UNK_ for ford and say , `` you can’t do that to ford , because ford takes care of me and i take care of you , and you can’t do that to ford . ''
and guess what ?
no problem .
they’re going to build in mexico .
they’re going to take away thousands of jobs .
it’s very bad for us .
so under president trump , here’s what would happen : the head of ford will call me back , i would say within an hour after i told them the bad news .
but it could be he’d want to be cool , and he’ll wait until the next day .
you know , they want to be a little cool .
and he’ll say , `` please , please , please . ''
he’ll _UNK_ for a little while , and i’ll say , `` no interest . ''
then he’ll call all sorts of political people , and i’ll say , `` sorry , _UNK_ .
no interest , '' because i don’t need _UNK_ money .
it’s nice .
i don’t need _UNK_ money .
i’m using my own money .
i’m not using the lobbyists .
i’m not using _UNK_ .
i don’t care .
i’m really rich .
i ( inaudible ) .
and by the way , i’m not even saying that in a _UNK_ that’s the kind of _UNK_ , that’s the kind of thinking you need for this country .
so _UNK_ because we got to make the country rich .
it sounds _UNK_ .
somebody said , `` oh , that’s _UNK_ . ''
it’s not _UNK_ .
we got $ 18 trillion in debt .
we got nothing but problems .
we got a military that needs equipment all over the place .
we got nuclear weapons that are _UNK_ .
we’ve got nothing .
we’ve got social security that’s going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn’t bring money into the country .
all these other people want to cut the hell out of it .
i’m not going to cut it at all ; i’m going to bring money in , and we’re going to save it .
but here’s what’s going to happen : after i’m called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns , after i’m called by all of the special interests and by the _UNK_ the _UNK_ and by the lobbyists _UNK_ and they have zero chance at _UNK_ me , zero _UNK_ i’ll get a call the next day from the head of ford .
he’ll say .
`` please _UNK_ , '' i’ll say no .
he’ll say , `` mr. president , we’ve decided to move the plant back to the united states , and we’re not going to build it in mexico . ''
that’s it .
they have no choice .
they have no choice .
there are hundreds of things like that .
i’ll give you another _UNK_ : saudi arabia , they make $ 1 billion a day .
$ 1 billion a day .
i love the _UNK_ .
many are in this building .
they make a billion dollars a day .
whenever they have problems , we send over the ships .
we say `` we’re _UNK_ _UNK_ protect . ''
what are we doing ?
they’ve got nothing but money .
if the right person asked them , they’d pay a fortune .
they wouldn’t be there except for us .
and believe me , you look at the border with yemen .
you remember obama a year ago , yemen was a great victory .
two weeks later , the place was _UNK_ up .
everybody got out _UNK_ and they kept our equipment .
they always keep our equipment .
we ought to send used equipment , right ?
they always keep our equipment .
we ought to send some real _UNK_ , because , frankly , it would be _UNK_ we ought to send our surplus .
we’re always losing this _UNK_ _UNK_ stuff .
but look at that border with saudi arabia .
do you really think that these people are interested in yemen ?
saudi arabia without us is gone .
they ; _UNK_ gone .
and i’m the one that made all of the right predictions about iraq .
you know , all of these politicians that i’m running against now _UNK_ it’s so nice to say i’m running as opposed to if i run , if i run .
i’m running .
but all of these politicians that i’m running against now , they’re trying to _UNK_ .
i mean , you looked at bush , it took him five days to answer the question on iraq .
he couldn’t answer the question .
he didn’t know .
i said , `` is he _UNK_ ? ''
then i looked at _UNK_ .
he was unable to answer the question , is iraq a good thing or bad thing ?
he didn’t know .
he couldn’t answer the question .
how are these people _UNK_ _UNK_ lead us ?
how are we _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ how are we _UNK_ _UNK_ go back and make it great again ?
we can’t .
they don’t have a _UNK_ .
they can’t lead us .
they can’t .
they can’t even answer simple questions .
it was terrible .
but saudi arabia is in big , big trouble .
now , thanks to _UNK_ and other things , the oil is all over the place .
and i used to say it , there are ships at sea , and this was during the worst crisis , that were _UNK_ up with oil , and the _UNK_ kept the price up , because , again , they were smarter than our leaders .
they were smarter than our leaders .
there is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again , and therefore make it great again .
because we need money .
we’re dying .
we’re dying .
we need money .
we have to do it .
and we need the right people .
so ford will come back .
they’ll all come back .
and i will say this , this is going to be an election , in my opinion , that’s based on _UNK_ .
so the reporter said to me the other day , `` but , mr. trump , you’re not a nice person .
how can you get people to vote for you ? ''
i said , `` i don’t know . ''
i said , `` i think that number one , i am a nice person .
i give a lot of money away to _UNK_ and other things .
i think i’m actually a very nice person . ''
but , i said , `` this is going to be an election that’s based on _UNK_ , because people are tired of these nice people .
and they’re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world .
and they’re tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per _UNK_ , than any nation in the world , and we are _UNK_ in the world , 25 countries are better than us in education .
and some of them are like third world countries .
but we’re becoming a third word country , because of our infrastructure , our airports , our roads , everything .
so one of the things i did , and i said , you know what i’ll do .
i’ll do it .
because a lot of people said , `` he’ll never run .
number one , he won’t want to give up his _UNK_ . ''
they’re right about that , but i’m doing it .
number two , i’m a private company , so nobody knows what i’m worth .
and the one thing is that when you run , you have to announce and _UNK_ to all sorts of _UNK_ authorities your net worth .
so i said , `` that’s _UNK_ '' i’m proud of my net worth .
i’ve done an amazing job .
i started off _UNK_ thank you _UNK_ i started off in a small office with my father in _UNK_ and _UNK_ , and my father said _UNK_ and i love my father .
i learned so much .
he was a great _UNK_ .
i learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with _UNK_ .
but i learned a lot .
but he used to say , `` donald , don’t go into manhattan .
that’s the big _UNK_ .
we don’t know anything about that .
don’t do it . ''
i said , `` i got _UNK_ go into manhattan .
i got _UNK_ build those big buildings .
i got _UNK_ do it , dad .
i’ve got _UNK_ do it . ''
and after four or five years in _UNK_ , i _UNK_ into manhattan and did a lot of great deals _UNK_ the grand _UNK_ _UNK_ .
i was responsible for the convention center on the west side .
i did a lot of great deals , and i did them early and young .
and now i’m building all over the world , and i love what i’m doing .
but they all said , a lot of the pundits on television , `` well , donald will never run , and one of the main reasons is he’s private and he’s probably not as successful as everybody thinks . ''
so i said to myself , you know , _UNK_ ever going to know unless i run , because i’m really proud of my success .
i really am .
i’ve _UNK_ _UNK_ i’ve _UNK_ tens of thousands of people over my lifetime .
that means medical .
that means education .
that means everything .
so a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months , because it’s big and complex , and they’ve put together a statement , a financial statement , just a _UNK_ .
but everything will be _UNK_ eventually with the government , and we don’t _UNK_ or anything .
we’ll be _UNK_ it right on time .
we don’t need anything .
and it was even reported _UNK_ yesterday , because they said , `` he had assets of $ 9 billion . ''
so i said ( _UNK_ ) , `` no , that’s the wrong number .
that’s the wrong number .
not assets . ''
so they put together this .
and before i say it , i have to say this .
i made it the _UNK_ way .
it’s real _UNK_ .
you know , it’s real _UNK_ .
it’s labor , and it’s unions good and some bad and _UNK_ of people that aren’t in unions , and it’s all over the place and building all over the world .
and i have assets _UNK_ big accounting firm , one of the most highly respected _UNK_ 9 billion _UNK_ million dollars .
and i have _UNK_ of about $ 500 million ( _UNK_ ) .
that’s long-term debt , very low interest rates .
in fact , one of the big banks came to me and said , `` donald , you don’t have enough _UNK_ .
could we loan you $ 4 billion '' ?
i said , `` i don’t need it .
i don’t want it .
and i’ve been there .
i don’t want it . ''
but in two _UNK_ , they give me whatever i wanted .
so i have a total net worth , and now with the increase , _UNK_ be _UNK_ $ 10 billion .
but here , a total net worth of _UNK_ net worth , not assets , not _UNK_ a net worth , after all debt , after all _UNK_ , the greatest assets _UNK_ trump tower , _UNK_ avenue of the americas , bank of america building in san _UNK_ , 40 wall street , sometimes referred to as the trump building right opposite the new york _UNK_ many other places all over the world .
so the total is $ _UNK_ .
now i’m not doing that ... i’m not doing that to _UNK_ , because you know what ?
i don’t have to _UNK_ .
i don’t have to , believe it or not .
i’m doing that to say that that’s the kind of thinking our country needs .
we need that thinking .
we have the opposite thinking .
we have _UNK_ .
we have _UNK_ .
we have people that don’t have it .
we have people that are morally corrupt .
we have people that are selling this country down the _UNK_ .
so i put together this statement , and the only reason i’m telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going , because if we have another three or four years _UNK_ you know , we’re at $ 8 trillion now .
we’re soon going to be at $ 20 _UNK_ : according to the economists _UNK_ who i’m not big _UNK_ in , but , nevertheless , this is what they’re saying _UNK_ that $ 24 trillion _UNK_ we’re very close _UNK_ that’s the point of no return .
$ 24 trillion .
we will be there soon .
that’s when we become _UNK_ .
that’s when we become a country that’s _UNK_ .
and we’re _UNK_ _UNK_ be there very soon .
we’re _UNK_ _UNK_ be there very soon .
i will immediately _UNK_ president _UNK_ illegal executive order on immigration , immediately .
fully support and back up the second amendment .
now , it’s very interesting .
today i heard it .
through _UNK_ , in a very , very hard core prison , _UNK_ named clinton , two vicious _UNK_ , two vicious people escaped , and nobody knows where they are .
and a woman was on television this morning , and she said , `` you know , mr. trump , '' and she was telling other people , and i actually called her , and she said , `` you know , mr. trump , i always was against guns .
i didn’t want guns .
and now since this happened '' _UNK_ it’s up in the prison area _UNK_ `` my husband and i are finally in agreement , because he wanted the guns .
we now have a gun on every table .
we’re ready to start shooting . ''
i said , `` very interesting . ''
so protect the second amendment .
end _UNK_ end common core .
common core should _UNK_ it is a disaster .
bush is _UNK_ in favor of common core .
i don’t see how he can possibly get the nomination .
he’s weak on immigration .
he’s in favor of common core .
how the hell can you vote for this guy ?
you just can’t do it .
we have to end _UNK_ education has to be local .
rebuild the country’s infrastructure .
nobody can do that like me .
believe me .
it will be done on time , on budget , way below cost , way below what anyone ever thought .
i look at the roads being built all over the country , and i say i can build those things for one-third .
what they do is _UNK_ , how bad .
you know , we’re building on pennsylvania avenue , the old post office , we’re _UNK_ it into one of the world’s great _UNK_ .
it’s _UNK_ _UNK_ be the best _UNK_ in washington , d.c. we got it from the general services administration in washington .
the obama administration .
we got it .
it was the most highly sought after _UNK_ or one of them , but i think the most highly sought after project in the history of general services .
we got it .
people were shocked , trump got it .
well , i got it for two reasons .
number one , we’re really good .
number two , we had a really good plan .
and i’ll add in the third , we had a great financial statement .
because the general services , who are terrific people , by the way , and talented people , they wanted to do a great job .
and they wanted to make sure it got built .
so we have to rebuild our infrastructure , our bridges , our _UNK_ , our airports .
you come into la _UNK_ airport , it’s like we’re in a third world country .
you look at the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ floor .
they throw down _UNK_ , and they throw .
you look at these airports , we are like a third world country .
and i come in from china and i come in from _UNK_ and i come in from different places , and they have the most incredible airports in the world .
you come to back to this country and you have _UNK_ , disaster .
you have all of these disastrous airports .
we have to rebuild our infrastructure .
save medicare , medicaid and social security without cuts .
have to do it .
get rid of the fraud .
get rid of the waste and abuse , but save it .
people have been paying it for years .
and now many of these candidates want to cut it .
you save it by making the united states , by making us rich again , by taking back all of the money that’s being lost .
_UNK_ our foreign trade deals .
reduce our $ 18 trillion in debt , because , believe me , we’re in a bubble .
we have _UNK_ low interest rates .
we have a stock market that , frankly , has been good to me , but i still hate to see what’s happening .
we have a stock market that is so _UNK_ .
be careful of a bubble because what you’ve seen in the past might be small _UNK_ compared to what happens .
so be very , very careful .
and strengthen our military and take care of our vets .
so , so important .
speech 7 chris , thank you very much .
i appreciate it .
this has been an amazing evening .
already , we’ve won five major states and it looks like we could win six or seven or eight or nine .
it’s really been _UNK_ it’s really been great .
i want to _UNK_ ted on the winning of texas .
he worked hard on he _UNK_ i know how hard he worked actually , and so i congratulate ted cruz on that win .
that was an excellent win .
we’re going to make america great again , folks .
we’re going to make it great again .
and , you know , i watched _UNK_ speech and she’s talking about wages have been poor and _UNK_ poor and _UNK_ doing badly , but we’re going to make it _UNK_ she’s been there for so long .
i mean , if she hasn’t _UNK_ it out by now , she’s not going to _UNK_ it out in the next four years .
it’s just going to become worse and worse .
she wants to make america whole again and i’m trying to figure out what is that all about .
make america great again is going to be much better than making america whole again .
so i just want to say that this was an exciting evening .
it’s so great to be in florida .
it’s so great to be at _UNK_ with friends and the press and the media and everybody .
i know it was a very tough night for _UNK_ _UNK_ .
he had a tough night but he worked hard .
he spent a lot of money .
he is a _UNK_ , as i’ve said many times before .
but you know what ?
we’re going to go to florida , we’re going to spend so much time in florida .
we’ve got about a _UNK_ lead .
i know that a lot of groups , a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want , they’re going to put $ 20 million or $ 25 million into it over the next two weeks , from what just came over the _UNK_ .
and frankly , i think that’s fine .
as far as i’m concerned , it’s fine .
and if he _UNK_ , they’ll have _UNK_ controlled _UNK_ total control .
but he’s not going anywhere anyway , but we’ll see what happens .
but we’re going to spend a lot of time in florida .
the virginia one was just a great win because it’s a place that is just _UNK_ and a place that we have big investments in , as we have in florida .
remember , we have thousands of employees in florida , all along miami , _UNK_ and _UNK_ and so many other places .
and it’s been an amazing place to invest .
it’s been amazing to have so many wonderful employees , so many of whom are here tonight , really urging us on .
and you know , i have thousands of employees all over the country , actually , all over the world but for purposes of tonight , we’ll just say all over the country .
and it’s been just so beautiful to watch this company grow and to watch it grow so strongly .
recent _UNK_ came out talking about how great a company we built , and now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation .
i mean , our nation is in serious trouble .
we’re being _UNK_ on trade , absolutely destroyed .
china is just taking advantage of us .
i have nothing against china .
i have great respect for china , but their leaders are too smart for our leaders .
our leaders don’t have a _UNK_ and the trade deficits at $ 400 billion and $ 500 are too much .
no country can sustain that kind of trade deficit .
it won’t be that way for long .
we have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already and , believe me , we’re going to _UNK_ those trade deals and it’s going to be a thing of beauty .
you look at countries like mexico , where they’re killing us on the border , absolutely destroying us on the border .
they’re destroying us in terms of economic development .
companies like carrier air _UNK_ just moving into mexico .
ford , moving into mexico .
_UNK_ , closing up shop in chicago and moving into mexico .
we have to stop it , folks .
i know how to stop it .
we’re going to create jobs .
we’re going to create jobs like you’ve never seen .
we’re going to lower taxes .
i have a plan that larry _UNK_ and so many others think is the best plan they’ve seen .
we’re going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class .
the middle class has been forgotten in our country .
it really helped and really probably was the _UNK_ factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and we’re all so proud of , but we’ve forgotten the middle class .
so we’re going to lower taxes .
we’re lowering taxes on business .
you look at all the companies that are moving out .
when you see _UNK_ moving to ireland and you see so many other companies , constantly now they’re leaving .
they used to move from new york to florida , or they’d move from new jersey to someplace else , chris .
but now they’re moving from here _UNK_ _UNK_ not that many people are leaving new jersey .
but chris understands the problem , fully understands .
now they’re leaving from places that they used to move to into other parts of the world .
we can’t let that happen .
we’ve lost our manufacturing jobs .
we’ve lost our manufacturing .
millions and millions of jobs , thousands and thousands and thousands of plants , manufacturing plants , _UNK_ .
i mean , we are losing so much .
we can’t let it happen .
i tell the story often about a friend of mine who is in the _UNK_ business and he always orders _UNK_ .
and recently , he ordered _UNK_ _UNK_ from japan because they’ve cut the _UNK_ .
they’ve _UNK_ the _UNK_ to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for _UNK_ to compete .
and i don’t want that to happen .
that’s not going to happen .
they shouldn’t be allowed to do it .
we have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source .
we have great , great power .
the problem is we have politicians who truly , truly , truly don’t know what they’re doing .
so we’re going to work very , very hard .
i’m so honored by this evening .
if you _UNK_ told me on june _UNK_ , when i was with my wife , _UNK_ , and we came down the _UNK_ in trump tower and it looked , literally , well , a little bit like this .
you have a lot of cameras here tonight .
it looked , literally , like the academy _UNK_ .
i never saw so many cameras in my life .
and it takes courage to run .
i’ll tell you what , it takes a lot of courage to run for president .
i’ve never done this before .
i’ve been a _UNK_ .
i’ve done a lot of things but this is something i’ve never done , but i felt we had to do it .
when you look at the _UNK_ of the iran deal , where we give $ 150 billion , we get absolutely nothing .
when you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military , which is really being _UNK_ rapidly , _UNK_ .
we’re going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before , and nobody , nobody , nobody is going to mess with us , folks , nobody .
so it’s just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight .
and if you want , press , i think we told you before we’d be okay if you want to ask a few questions .
yes , go ahead .
well , they can always do that and then they’ll _UNK_ then they’ll just lose everything and that would be the _UNK_ that would be the work of a _UNK_ .
but let me just explain something .
if you’ve seen what’s happened , whether you go to south carolina , where i had a huge victory , where we had a tremendous victory in new hampshire , tremendous in nevada , you look at what’s happened , and tonight , of course , is the best of all .
i mean , right now , they’re projected i guess six , but we could be seven , eight , nine , and major states .
it’s georgia , alabama , massachusetts _UNK_ ( _UNK_ ) _UNK_ tennessee , virginia .
and you know , these are amazing states and we’re going to probably get a lot more .
in fact , we’re projected to have some pretty good additional numbers .
but i will say this .
look , we have expanded the republican party .
when you look at what’s happened in south carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got , in terms of extra people coming in .
they came from the democratic party , or the democrat party , and they’re democrats and they’re _UNK_ democrats and they were never going to _UNK_ and they all _UNK_ .
and they were independents .
and we’ve actually expanded the party .
look at the number of votes we had in that area , as an example .
four years ago , they had _UNK_ or so votes .
we doubled it .
we were almost _UNK_ _UNK_ the democrats went down .
there’s much less _UNK_ for the democrats .
so i _UNK_ look , i’m a _UNK_ .
i know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe , but believe me , i am a _UNK_ .
once we get all of this finished , i’m going to go after one person , that’s hillary clinton , on the assumption she’s allowed to run , which is a big assumption .
i don’t know that she’s going to be allowed to run .
and i think that’s , frankly , going to be an easy race .
you see the polls .
i beat hillary in many polls .
i know one thing .
i don’t think _UNK_ is going to be able to beat her .
i don’t think _UNK_ in all fairness , i think ted’s going to have a very hard time .
but ted at least has a shot because at least he’s won a little bit .
so i just tell you this .
we are going to be a much _UNK_ party , a much _UNK_ we’re going to be a unified party , i mean , to be honest with you .
and we are going to be a much bigger party , and you can see that happening .
we’re going to be a much bigger party .
our party is expanding .
and all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where i’ve won and just look _UNK_ we’ve gone from _UNK_ number to a much larger number .
that hasn’t happened to the republican party in many , many decades .
so i think we’re going to be more inclusive .
i think we’re going to be more unified and i think we’re going to be a much bigger party , and i think we’re going to win in november .
_UNK_ , yeah ?
i’m just doing what’s right .
look , planned _UNK_ has done very good work for some _UNK_ for many , many _UNK_ for millions of women .
and i’ll say it and i know a lot of the so-called _UNK_ , they say that’s really _UNK_ because i’m a conservative , but i’m a common-sense conservative .
but millions of women have been helped by planned _UNK_ .
but we’re not going to allow and we’re not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at planned _UNK_ , and we understand that and i’ve said it loud and clear .
but _UNK_ and we’ll see what happens .
but planned _UNK_ _UNK_ millions of people _UNK_ and i’ve had thousands of letters from women that have been helped .
and this wasn’t a _UNK_ .
this was people writing letters .
i’m going to be really good for women .
i’m going to be good for women’s health issues .
it’s very important to me , very important to me .
and maybe that’s not a perfect conservative view , but i can tell you one thing .
i’m more conservative than anybody on the military , on taking care of our vets , on the border , on the wall , on getting rid of obamacare and coming up with something much , much better , and certainly , getting rid of common core and bringing education to a local level so that you’re going to have good education for our children who are being absolutely _UNK_ for proper education .
so _UNK_ , i mean , you know , you can call it what you want , but i am a _UNK_ and i will tell the truth , _UNK_ ?
yeah , go ahead , finish it .
i feel _UNK_ good .
i mean , i’m watching your people _UNK_ i’m watching your people on _UNK_ and i’m going to be very nice , i’m going to be very nice _UNK_ i’m watching your people on cnn and i’m watching the fox people and i’m watching the _UNK_ people , too , _UNK_ ?
see ?
i’m becoming diplomatic .
and they are certainly being very nice to me tonight .
i mean , you know , they’re being very strong .
and they are , they’re _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ the big _UNK_ of the night , which is true .
he didn’t win anything .
he hasn’t won anything , period .
and by the way , and i have to tell you _UNK_ and he was very , very _UNK_ .
i’ve never heard a person get up and speak on an evening like this and be so _UNK_ , but he’s got a right to be _UNK_ .
he hasn’t won anything and he’s not going to win very much .
but i do congratulate ted because i know how hard ted worked on texas and it’s a big get .
now i also did very well in texas .
i came in second .
and one of the things my son , eric , told me , which i didn’t even realize , is that not only did i win most of the states _UNK_ and some are coming in and i’m expected to win them _UNK_ but i came in second _UNK_ i came in no worse than second .
so it wasn’t like i won and then i disappeared .
the worst i had was a second .
so i’m very , very honored by the _UNK_ , _UNK_ ?
yes , go ahead .
right .
oh , they’re _UNK_ wrong .
look , i _UNK_ .
i _UNK_ when i _UNK_ in fact , chris is my number one _UNK_ chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign .
he called me .
he said , `` donald , what you’ve got is a movement . ''
we spoke today in _UNK_ .
you’ve never seen a crowd like that .
that had to be 20,000 people inside this massive convention center and it was incredible .
and every place we’re speaking , if we have 10,000 people it’s like a small group .
we had _UNK_ people the other day in alabama .
and when chris called , he said this is a movement ; this is something like i’ve never seen .
and in all fairness to the press , a lot of the press have said the same thing .
they’ve never seen what’s happening right now .
they’ve never seen anything like it .
and i’m just honored by it .
now , when chris joined , we had a news conference and they asked me the _UNK_ same question .
i said i _UNK_ .
now , right after the program that we’re talking about _UNK_ and i thought it was clear , but you know , we’re talking about groups , groups , groups .
i do have to know the name of the group because , who knows ?
i mean , they have to give me the name of the group .
but right after , when i reviewed it , i put out a _UNK_ and i put out on facebook that i _UNK_ _UNK_ .
now everybody knew i did that but the press refused to look at that .
it was right after .
and i _UNK_ then ; i _UNK_ today on _UNK_ with george _UNK_ , i _UNK_ again .
i mean , how many times are you supposed to _UNK_ ?
but i _UNK_ and hopefully it’s the final time i have to do it .
but if you look at facebook and if you look at twitter , right after the show i put out a statement because i want everybody to be sure .
yes , go ahead .
no , it’s not , but there is always going to be some negotiation , and it’s going to be a good negotiation , not a bad negotiation .
it’s going to be a negotiation where we’ll start at certain levels and hopefully i will make a great deal , and _UNK_ of great deals , for the american people .
so you know , look , you can’t go around just signing our little notices that the president signs all the time , executive orders , he’s done executive order , executive order .
it’s almost like , i don’t even know .
does he ever go a deal with congress anymore ?
does he ever speak to the senate ?
does he ever speak with congressmen and get them into a room and get things done ?
you know , a good example of this , in all fairness , is something that i _UNK_ is very , very important to me ; corporate _UNK_ .
carl _UNK_ , who’s a friend of mine who _UNK_ me , great _UNK_ , he _UNK_ it _UNK_ him so much he calls me about it all the time , where we’re losing companies .
and we’re losing for two reasons .
we’re losing for a lot of reasons but the taxes are too high .
we have the highest _UNK_ we’re the highest _UNK_ nation in the world .
and very importantly , they have trillions , for companies , trillions of dollars outside of this country .
the democrats agree it should be brought back in .
the republicans agree it should be brought back in .
everybody agrees it should be brought back in .
i could sit in a room _UNK_ or the oval office _UNK_ for a period of , literally , a half hour and i really believe i could get everybody _UNK_ every single _UNK_ you know , it’s one thing they don’t agree on health care or they don’t agree on common core or they don’t agree on other things and they’ll fight .
here’s something every single _UNK_ i mean , almost everybody agrees .
these trillions and trillions of dollars should be brought into the country .
the president can’t make a deal .
the reason is he doesn’t know how to make a deal , probably doesn’t work at it , probably doesn’t care , but you’re talking about tremendous number of _UNK_ tremendous amounts of money .
so when you have something that everybody wants and you can’t make a deal , there’s something going on that’s really wrong .
and what it means is you have the wrong leader .
yes ?
well , look , everything _UNK_ we are going to have a wall .
i can tell you we are going to have a wall .
i watched the _UNK_ of mexico , the _UNK_ of this man .
and i get along great with _UNK_ .
you saw in nevada , i won in the poll , the hispanic vote .
i have thousands of people that work for me right now that are hispanic .
i’ve had thousands and thousands over my lifetime .
these are great people .
the mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders and you saw it .
_UNK_ fox , first of all , he used a word that you should never have _UNK_ if i ever used that word you folks _UNK_ never , ever , ever let me get away with it .
nobody even talked about the word he used and this is the ultimate word .
but he was angry at the concept of somebody saying that they were going to pay for the wall .
mexico is going to pay for the wall .
we have a trade deficit with mexico of $ _UNK_ billion a year _UNK_ $ _UNK_ billion .
the wall is going to cost $ 10 billion .
it’s so easy .
i’ve had these guys that i’m on the stage with go you don’t really mean mexico is going to pay for the wall .
one _UNK_ as sure as you’re standing there , 100 percent , mexico’s going to pay , 100 percent .
and the reason is i’m a _UNK_ .
i know how to do this .
politicians are all talk , no action .
it’s not going to _UNK_ except for chris _UNK_ , of course .
it’s not _UNK_ look , it’s not going to happen .
it’s not going to happen with these people .
so when you think of it _UNK_ and then they say you’ll never be able to build a wall .
well , it’s 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles .
the great wall of china , built 2,000 years ago , is _UNK_ miles , folks , and they didn’t have _UNK_ _UNK_ , because i only want to use _UNK_ , if you want to know the truth , or john _UNK_ .
i buy a lot of equipment from john _UNK_ .
i love john _UNK_ , too .
but they didn’t have _UNK_ .
they didn’t have _UNK_ .
they didn’t have _UNK_ equipment .
the wall is _UNK_ miles long .
we need 1,000 miles and we have all of the materials .
we can do that so _UNK_ .
and this is going to be a serious wall .
this is going to be high wall .
this is going to be a very serious wall .
we’re going to stop drugs from coming into new hampshire .
you know , when i won new hampshire , those people were so incredible to me .
and when you go , you wouldn’t believe it because it’s so _UNK_ , so beautiful .
you look at the fields and you look at everything , it’s so beautiful .
and yet , you go to a meeting in new hampshire , their number one problem , their number one problem is _UNK_ .
the _UNK_ is _UNK_ in and they have so many of their young people and other people _UNK_ .
and i told them i’m going to stop it .
i’m going to stop it .
we’re going to have a strong border , and i mean strong .
and by the way , speaking of people , people are going to come in and they’re going to come into this country , but they’re going to come in legally , _UNK_ ?
i’ve got to find out what’s going on .
we’ve got a big problem .
we have a big , big problem .
i’ll tell it like it is .
we have a big , big problem .
we’ve got to figure it out .
we’re going to figure it out .
radical islamic terrorism , big , big problem , not only for us .
you take a look at germany , you take a look at _UNK_ , you take a look at _UNK_ .
you look at some of these places , it’s like a disaster .
and we’re not going to allow people to come into our country who we have no idea who they are , we have no idea where they come from , they have no _UNK_ , they’re young and they’re strong .
you look at that _UNK_ line ; they’re young , they’re strong , they’re powerful .
and you say why aren’t they back fighting for their country ?
now , with all of that being said , i feel strongly _UNK_ i have a bigger heart than anybody .
we’re going to build a safe zone .
it’s going to be in syria .
and i’m going to get the gulf states , who have more money than anybody _UNK_ we’ve got to _UNK_ up their _UNK_ a little bit .
we’re going to get _UNK_ but they’re not accepting people .
we’re going to get _UNK_ wait , wait , wait .
we’re going to get the gulf states to pay for it because they should .
oh , we’re going to bring them back .
we’re going to bring them back .
look , i’m telling you _UNK_ you know how i’m going to bring them back ?
first of all , we’re going to do great with the _UNK_ americans , and you see that in the polls where i had in one poll where i’m 25 percent .
and one of the commentators , who i think is standing right at the back of the room in the corner , said , you know , if donald trump gets 25 percent of the african-american vote , this election is over .
you watch .
and the reason i’m getting that _UNK_ and i’m going to do great with the _UNK_ .
i’m going to do great with virtually every group .
the reason is i’m going to bring jobs back .
i’m going to get apple to start making their computers and their _UNK_ on our land , not in china .
how does it help us when they make it in china ?
well , look , i always liked _UNK_ until about a week ago when he decided to go hostile .
he decided to become _UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ ?
but _UNK_ _UNK_ has a lot more talent .
honestly , i did , i always liked him but he became _UNK_ you know , somebody told him you’re losing very badly .
the only way you can possibly win , take the _UNK_ mary , they called it a _UNK_ mary , the folks in the back , and go hostile .
it’s hurt him .
in fact , one of the _UNK_ tonight said he went down 15 or 20 percent .
it’s really hurt him .
but look , i’m not going to tell him what to do .
i’m not going to tell anybody what to do .
you have to run .
he had a bad night , according to cnn , fox .
i watched their _UNK_ .
they say the _UNK_ of the night was _UNK_ _UNK_ and it’s true .
he didn’t win anything .
he hasn’t won .
i mean , at least you can say that ted has won something , and you know , _UNK_ has not won .
you’ve got to be able to win .
you can’t talk .
you know , these politicians , all talk , no action .
you’ve got to be able to win something .
he hasn’t won anything .
and he actually hasn’t come very close .
so we’ll see what happens .
yes , go ahead .
i’m going to be a good president for the world but we have a country that’s in big trouble .
our infrastructure is going to hell , our roads , our highways , our schools , our hospitals , our airports .
i go throughout the world .
i mean , you go to _UNK_ , you go to _UNK_ some people say _UNK_ , but you go to _UNK_ , you go to any of _UNK_ so many places .
you go to different places in china , different places in asia , different places in the middle east , you look at some of the airports they have .
you look at the _UNK_ they have .
you look at the transportation systems they have and the trains they have .
we’re like a third world country .
so i am going to be very good for the world .
i’m going to get along with the world .
you’re going to be very proud of me .
even you will be very proud of me as a president .
but we have to rebuild our country .
our country is going to hell and people don’t understand that .
and hillary clinton doesn’t have a _UNK_ .
she can’t do that .
she’s talking about _UNK_ i mean , one of the things that has really _UNK_ me , i think one of the reasons i have such great support , is that people , you take a look , people in the _UNK_ groups are making less money today _UNK_ less money than they made 12 years ago .
and in her speech , she just said they’re making less money .
well , she’s been there with obama for a long period of time .
why hasn’t she done anything about it ?
_UNK_ everything that she was _UNK_ about _UNK_ she’s picked up what i say .
the difference is she’s been there for a long period of time .
why haven’t they done anything about it ?
then you look at her record as secretary of state .
it’s _UNK_ .
you look at what’s going on with syria .
you look at what’s going on with everything .
it’s a disaster .
so we’re going to have an interesting period of time .
i don’t know that she’s going to be allowed to run .
what she did is a criminal act .
if she’s allowed to run i would be very , very surprised .
but if she’s allowed to run , honestly , _UNK_ be a _UNK_ day for this country because what she did was wrong .
and what she did _UNK_ ( _UNK_ ) _UNK_ let me just tell you , what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they paid a very , very big price .
_UNK_ , one or two more questions .
yeah , go ahead , _UNK_ at this moment , absolutely not , no .
we either have a country or we don’t .
we have a country , or we don’t .
we have borders or we don’t have borders .
and at this moment , the answer is absolutely not .
well , look , i don’t expect _UNK_ i have a lot of respect for _UNK_ and for the group and i like the _UNK_ and i don’t know that i’ve been treated fairly or not .
i really don’t know .
i can’t tell you that .
but i can tell you that i do respect them .
what i really have is a great number of people .
i have millions and millions of people .
and when i was watching this _UNK_ just a little while ago , before i came in here because i wanted to see exactly where we were before i started speaking , i was _UNK_ at the kind of numbers .
the republicans have tremendous energy .
the democrats don’t .
they don’t have any energy .
their numbers are down .
our number are through the roof .
and people are making the statements they’ve never seen , in modern times , a party that was so _UNK_ .
i think if somebody is doing as well as i’m doing _UNK_ and i’m not just speaking for myself , whether it be me or anybody else _UNK_ but if i’m going to win five _UNK_ i’ve already won five , but maybe it could be six , seven , eight , nine .
it could be nine , could win nine states tonight .
if i’m going to win all of these states with tremendous numbers , and if i’m going to come in the worst is second in the two or three that i might not win , i think , you know , we’re a democracy .
i think it’s _UNK_ hard to say that’s not the person we want to lead the party , right ?
you know , it’s very hard .
but i really think that _UNK_ i think it’s a great question , david , because i really think that one of the biggest things that everybody is seeing happening , and everybody , is the republican party has become more dynamic .
it’s become more diverse .
we’re taking from the democrats .
we’re taking from the independents .
we have a lot more people .
we have a lot more people .
i mean , take a look at south carolina .
look at the numbers .
look at the numbers from four years ago when nobody even wanted to waste their time and vote .
and then you look at _UNK_ i was there and you had lines that went a mile long .
and it was virtually more than doubled .
so we have a very , very dynamic party and i think we’re going to be able to _UNK_ the party .
i hope to be able to get along with everybody .
i don’t know paul ryan well but i hope to be able to get along with him .
i do know mitch mcconnell a little bit but i hope to be able to get along with him .
but remember this .
i have millions and millions and millions of people .
this isn’t like it’s a close match .
i mean , it’s only too bad that winner didn’t take all , because if winner took all , this thing is over .
we’re just having a celebration .
you know , we’re having a celebration .
so anyway , i would like to _UNK_ look , i just want to end by thanking everybody .
this has been an amazing period in my life .
my wife just called and _UNK_ , as you know , is going to be having a baby very soon and she’s a special person and it’s going to be great and we look forward to that .
she’s back in new york .
she wanted to be here .
they all wanted to be here but they’re with _UNK_ now and that could be , certainly , within the next week .
but this this has been an amazing period of time .
it’s been amazing for me , even from an educational _UNK_ .
and i think , honestly , we’ve done something that almost nobody thought could be done and i’m very proud of it .
and i just want to leave you with this .
i am a _UNK_ .
i would love to see the republican party and everybody get together and _UNK_ .
and when we _UNK_ , there’s nobody , nobody that’s going to beat us .
thank you very much everybody .
thank you .
thank you very much .
thank you .
speech 8 this is so _UNK_ so incredible .
_UNK_ we _UNK_ we have had , no matter where we go _UNK_ you know , it’s a movement , folks .
this is a movement .
no matter where we go , it’s amazing .
we go to dallas .
we go to oklahoma .
we go all over .
we went to , the other night , iowa _UNK_ _UNK_ .
every place _UNK_ new hampshire , _UNK_ .
every place we go to , it’s like this .
it’s amazing .
and just great , great people .
and they actually had to tell over 3,000 people , `` go home . ''
we’ll come back .
we’ll do another one .
but they had to go home .
would you like to leave and we’ll let them come in ?
no ?
i don’t think so , but we _UNK_ they turned away a lot of people , which is too bad , actually .
so maybe next time .
i don’t know .
i think this is the largest room .
i know it’s a record for the room .
you know , it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people , and they’re standing .
they’re not sitting .
so that’s great .
i love _UNK_ we love setting records .
we want the country to set records , right ?
so , you know , i _UNK_ i do this , and i love to do it .
and i talk about our success because that’s ultimately what it’s all about .
i think we’re going to do _UNK_ well in iowa .
i really think we’re going to do great there .
and i could say , `` oh , _UNK_ , if we came in the top four of five . ''
i’m not _UNK_ i’m looking to win everything .
we want to run the table .
we want to run it , because that sends a signal .
and , you know , we’ve been a little bit _UNK_ we had to respond to hillary .
she came out with that _UNK_ she came out _UNK_ remember , she wrote _UNK_ she said , `` he’s got a _UNK_ he’s demonstrated a _UNK_ '' _UNK_ i demonstrated _UNK_ `` a _UNK_ for _UNK_ . ''
can you believe it ?
me ?
nobody respects women more than donald trump .
that i can tell you .
and , you know , when she said that , i had no choice , because i didn’t start it .
i had no choice .
and i did have to mention her _UNK_ situation .
_UNK_ ?
( laughter ) and that is now the biggest story on television by a factor of _UNK_ so , we have to do it .
you can’t let people push you around .
you can’t let people tell lies .
you can’t do it .
you know , it’s interesting .
one of the polls came out from _UNK_ and they said that if it’s trump against hillary in the election , it will be the greatest voter _UNK_ in the history of this country .
i can see that .
i can see it .
and they said all of these people that are going to come in new , that never vote _UNK_ they never vote , they don’t care _UNK_ they’re going to mostly _UNK_ i’ll tell you what , they’re going to vote for trump .
that’s why they’re coming in , because they’re so fed up with the system _UNK_ this corrupt , _UNK_ system .
they’re fed up with it and they’re fed up with those guys back there , the media .
trump : they are the worst .
no , no , no .
they’re fed up .
they’re fed up with the media .
i mean , i’ve got _UNK_ and you know , not all bad , but there’s so much _UNK_ in the media .
and i like to call it out .
and one of the things that’s really been amazing to me , and such _UNK_ it’s been so beautiful to watch _UNK_ the level of genius in the public .
they get it , you know ?
they really get it .
they want to _UNK_ us , they want to do all of this and they want to make everybody look like , `` oh , _UNK_ . ''
the level of genius _UNK_ they fully understand .
they know they’re _UNK_ , they know they’re _UNK_ and they really _UNK_ otherwise , who gets worse _UNK_ than me ?
( laughter ) and yet , i see a poll at _UNK_ percent .
and you know , you’re talking about 15 , 16 people , started with _UNK_ how are you ?
started with 17 people .
and you know , i’d be happy with _UNK_ if we had three , _UNK_ ?
not _UNK_ , i’d like to be that _UNK_ over that 50 mark , but i think we’re doing really well .
and you know , it’s interesting , but the debates _UNK_ _UNK_ so the debates _UNK_ thank _UNK_ i love you too , _UNK_ .
( laughter ) i love you .
i do .
i love you .
i love every _UNK_ you know what ?
the rooms , no matter where , whether it’s _UNK_ or big _UNK_ like this one , it’s amazing , and there’s love in the room .
and i told _UNK_ the other night , i said and a friend of mine , very , very successful guy who i would love to have negotiating against china .
that’s what we need , not these _UNK_ that we have .
no , no .
i have guys ... carl _UNK_ _UNK_ me .
great business man .
we have _UNK_ i have great , great business people that want to be involved .
and we’re going to use _UNK_ we have the best .
we have the best in the world .
we don’t use them .
we use political _UNK_ , we use special interest people that really don’t care about the country , they care about their deals .
this is going to change so fast .
you know , last year , $ 500 billion trade deficit with china .
think about it .
you know what $ 500 billion is ?
you do _UNK_ you do $ 100 bills , you would fill the room to the ceiling , $ 500 billion deficit _UNK_ trade deficit with china .
what are we ?
are we _UNK_ yes , i guess the answer is certainly let’s not blame us .
our leaders are _UNK_ and _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ you have to say _UNK_ they have deals , because what’s happened is all of this money is being given to them by special interests , by all of these people , including lobbyists , and these lobbyists make our leaders do _UNK_ our leaders , can you believe our leaders ?
this is what _UNK_ but they make the leaders of our country do things that they don’t even want to do because they’ve given them tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars .
i look at this guy _UNK_ bush .
he spent $ _UNK_ million on his campaign and he is down in the grave .
he is nowhere .
no , no .
think of it .
it’s got to be much more than that .
it was actually $ _UNK_ million a while ago .
every time i turn on an add , i see an ad about trump .
i mean , it’s not that bad an ad either .
it’s like _UNK_ you know .
if you’re going to do an ad , do an ad .
but he’s a _UNK_ person .
let’s face it .
we don’t need _UNK_ .
we need _UNK_ of energy .
but he spent _UNK_ think of it .
think of it .
he spent $ _UNK_ million .
i spent nothing , right ?
nothing .
now , i’m going to be spending .
you probably saw i’m going to spend _UNK_ now , we’re going to start spending a lot of money because i don’t want to take any chances .
you know , it’s _UNK_ i love getting up _UNK_ and for the last couple of months , i have been leading from _UNK_ the time i announced , right ?
and for the last _UNK_ and leading a lot .
i’m going to go over that because i go over ( _UNK_ ) polls .
i love polls .
i love polls .
now , when they _UNK_ if they turn negative , i don’t like them .
and i promise , if they turn negative , i’m not going to be talking about them .
in fact , i get _UNK_ all the time .
you’re always talking about your polls .
one of these guys just got two .
he’s at two .
i’m at _UNK_ and one of these guys who’s at two said , `` he always talks about his polls and i don’t . ''
i wouldn’t either if i had two , i _UNK_ i wouldn’t .
i wouldn’t .
i wouldn’t do it at all .
but you know , i love to tell the story where i have spent nothing and bush has spent $ _UNK_ million , but much higher than that .
that’s just _UNK_ you know , because i see since then _UNK_ i mean , just _UNK_ you can’t turn on this television without these _UNK_ .
and fox _UNK_ every two minutes it’s a commercial on trump .
you know what he did ?
it’s false _UNK_ .
so i killed him in the debate .
according to _UNK_ , according to everybody , _UNK_ , who’s an amazing guy , by the way .
if you don’t know _UNK_ _UNK_ matt _UNK_ .
right ?
he’s a great guy .
but _UNK_ , _UNK_ percent .
at _UNK_ percent , you have 15 people .
now , if you noticed a couple have dropped out .
a couple or more .
but 15 , 16 people _UNK_ _UNK_ percent .
time magazine , _UNK_ percent .
think of it .
_UNK_ , _UNK_ percent .
u.s. news and world report _UNK_ _UNK_ percent said i won the debate .
i _UNK_ the debate , right ?
_UNK_ , public _UNK_ system _UNK_ _UNK_ percent said trump won .
no , you know , it is amazing .
we have washington times at _UNK_ percent .
_UNK_ , _UNK_ percent .
fox , _UNK_ percent _UNK_ fox las _UNK_ , _UNK_ percent .
so , they all say _UNK_ then they go back home , after the debate .
i like to see how did i do ?
did i look good ?
looking good is very important , right ?
sometimes , it is not as much like what you say , it’s how did you look ?
oh , i looked good , didn’t sound too good , but that is _UNK_ you wonder if that is a good _UNK_ .
but i go home , and i watch , and the pundits will say _UNK_ and they can’t _UNK_ kill me , because we know it is happening , we know what’s happening _UNK_ well , mr. trump was _UNK_ tonight .
he was _UNK_ i won every single online poll , i won .
and then , here’s bush .
so , bush does an ad .
and he takes me _UNK_ and he was talking about , you know , something , and manage _UNK_ and then i killed him .
i mean , he _UNK_ by the way , i met _UNK_ percent , he is at 1 percent , he got .
he came in last .
he takes the ad _UNK_ and i shouldn’t even talk about him .
he’s down to two or three _UNK_ i _UNK_ but it _UNK_ me when i see a guy spending , you know , $ 60 million on ads against me , a lot of it , right ?
i say , why is he doing this ?
doesn’t he have something better , he should go home .
just _UNK_ .
you know , honestly , he should go home and _UNK_ .
he shouldn’t be _UNK_ his time .
but it does .
i say , why is this guy spending all this money ?
now he is spending it actually against a couple of other guys , they were also very weak and somewhere _UNK_ but here is my ad .
so , he made a statement , and after that , his _UNK_ people said , oh , he was great .
he took on trump , he took on trump .
i’m standing here , he’s over here .
took on trump , he made a statement that was written by his _UNK_ .
you know ?
so , he would remember ( _UNK_ ) it .
he said , `` mr. trump , why don’t you this ? ''
i said , _UNK_ then i gave him an answer .
i said , `` _UNK_ , i’m at _UNK_ , you are at _UNK_ right ?
it is a simple answer .
you started off here , right next to me , and then you were there , then you were there , by the next time , you are going to be off the stage .
right ?
no , no , it’s true .
and then _UNK_ and then _UNK_ and that was it .
and so i responded .
so , he asked me a question , question was fine .
you know , _UNK_ written .
so , he asked me a question , good .
i give him an answer , i blow him away .
right .
everyone says trump won the debate .
everybody .
and _UNK_ is it .
so , the ad is him asking the question and i’m standing there like this , because i haven’t _UNK_ in fact , you see in one of them , i’m just about ready to open my _UNK_ .
but he doesn’t let me respond .
that is almost false _UNK_ , isn’t it ?
you know ?
so , i mentioned it , hillary is a disaster .
i mean , hillary .
hillary is controlled by her money .
so is _UNK_ .
so is _UNK_ by the way , i’m the only one _UNK_ my campaign .
i’m _UNK_ .
you know , one of the things that makes me happy .
i heard one of my commentators this morning , said , `` you know , i’ve been watching this stuff for 50 years and i’ve never seen anything like what has happened with trump .
one of them actually said _UNK_ one of them _UNK_ i’m special .
you’re special .
i like you .
i’m special .
isn’t that nice ?
that’s a very _UNK_ every once in a while , somebody can say something that hits you .
where are you ?
who said that ?
_UNK_ .
so nice .
thank you .
that is a nice one .
that’s like , you know , very once in a while , there is a statement that is either nice or brutal .
i think _UNK_ was a brutal statement , right ?
_UNK_ can be applied to hillary .
i just don’t like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies .
right ?
because i consider them enemies .
we view this as war .
don’t we view this as war ?
it’s war .
it’s war .
and so , you don’t like to use it .
i hate to give it up .
what ?
how are you going to help my little girl ( _UNK_ ) , daughter ?
oh , we are going to help your daughter .
we are going to help the country , that’s called helping the daughter .
we are going to help your country .
so , here is the story .
so , we are in a situation where we have _UNK_ leadership , where our trade deals are killing us , our military is not prepared .
general _UNK_ when he left , just recently , he said that we are less prepared than at any time that he can remember .
and i think he went back _UNK_ he beginning , but let’s say second world war .
_UNK_ ?
that’s enough .
and we should be very prepared now , because the world _UNK_ us .
she has done a terrible job as secretary of state .
think of it .
putin comes out , he said , donald trump is brilliant , he is doing an amazing job , and he is leading the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , that’s nice .
and she and my opponents _UNK_ oh , isn’t it terrible that putin said _UNK_ wouldn’t it be nice if we could get along with the world ?
wouldn’t it be ?
seriously .
no , no , wouldn’t it be nice ?
i mean , they want me to _UNK_ his statement .
how _UNK_ you say i’m brilliant ?
how _UNK_ _UNK_ that’s _UNK_ who’s going to do that ?
and by the way , if he said it about anyone of them , they would have been very happy .
but the point is , we have to get along .
the world has _UNK_ up around barack obama .
now , i don’t know if you saw his recent release .
they were talking about the department of state , state department , and they said very strongly , you know , the things that they’ve done .
well , they couldn’t find it because what have they done that’s good ?
and they said bringing peace to syria .
did you see that ?
so instead of saying they made a mistake _UNK_ call it a _UNK_ , they made a mistake _UNK_ they’re trying to justify it .
well , we meant we’re working on it .
can you believe _UNK_ bringing peace to syria .
the world is _UNK_ up , the _UNK_ in syria _UNK_ they say one of their achievements for the year is bringing peace to syria , and the whole world’s talking about it .
it’s _UNK_ the level of _UNK_ is incredible .
i’m telling you .
i used to use the word _UNK_ , now i just call them _UNK_ .
i went to an _UNK_ league school , i’m very highly educated .
i know words , i had the best words .
i have _UNK_ but there’s no better word than _UNK_ .
right ?
there is none .
there is none .
there’s no _UNK_ there’s no _UNK_ there’s no word like that .
so we are going to turn things around .
but _UNK_ and if we have hillary _UNK_ i’ve got to tell you .
i just saw where for the last week she’s been hitting me really hard with the women card , _UNK_ ?
really hard .
and i had to say _UNK_ , that’s enough , that’s enough .
and we did a strong number .
she’s not going to win .
any by the way , i love the concept _UNK_ i love , love , love having a woman president .
can’t be her .
she’s _UNK_ .
she’s _UNK_ .
and you know really don’t _UNK_ i’ll tell you who does not like _UNK_ yeah , we’ll get _UNK_ .
good .
let’s do _UNK_ .
but i’ll tell you who doesn’t like hillary are women .
women don’t like hillary .
i see it all the time .
and always so _UNK_ ; mr. trump said this and that and this .
and you just _UNK_ i actually _UNK_ i shouldn’t do it .
i just have to turn off the television so many times .
she just gives me a _UNK_ .
but you know _UNK_ although i think last night i gave her a big _UNK_ .
i can imagine _UNK_ i can imagine those discussions .
but you have to hit back hard , and you can’t let them push you around .
and today , she gave a speech and she never even mentioned my name .
you know , in the debate i was mentioned nine times , i mean everything .
all of them .
but her .
i was mentioned nine times , none of the other candidates were mentioned .
and then she came out with the _UNK_ , which is so _UNK_ .
and _UNK_ but she’s playing that card .
and then i had to hit her back , so i hit her back and i talked about her husband and the abuse of women and the tremendous abuse _UNK_ no , it’s tremendous abuse .
i mean , you look at it , it’s tremendous abuse .
and i talked about that .
and now today , the television is going _UNK_ , and she gets up , makes a speech and doesn’t even mention anything about me with _UNK_ or anything else .
i wonder why _UNK_ i wonder why .
and remember this ; it’s really important .
a poll just came out where we’re tied , another one came out a couple of weeks ago , fox , where i’m leading by four or five points against her individually .
we’re doing great .
i haven’t even focused on her yet .
look at the people i’ve focused on .
i don’t want to really knock them , i don’t want to mention their names .
but , you know , of those people that are all gone , they were all people that attacked me .
wouldn’t it be nice if our country could have that same thing ?
you attack and they’re , boom , gone .
and if we could do it _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ you know , if we could do it _UNK_ that’s even better , right ?
you know , who wants to use our military ?
by the way , we are going to build the strongest , the best , the most powerful military ever .
ever .
ever .
and we’re going to take care of our vets , we’re going to take care of our vets _UNK_ and it will cost you much less money , and it will be great .
i mean , you are signing in programs , things that you will never , ever use , you know that .
and you are paying for it .
and you will never ever use them .
so we will get that _UNK_ out .
we are going to _UNK_ a lot of things .
we are going to _UNK_ out common core .
common core is dead .
it’s going to be dead .
when i look at parents and i see local parents in iowa and new hampshire and south carolina , i went to a school and i saw the parents , they love their children .
they want that _UNK_ they want education .
they love _UNK_ they don’t care about money , they don’t care about anything .
they love their children and it’s local .
and they get together and they do wonderful programs .
they are smart people as opposed to getting it done by bureaucrats that are getting big , _UNK_ checks in washington .
i mean , we have such talent in this country and we don’t use it .
so , obamacare , dead .
common core , gone .
we are going to get rid of it .
department of education , we are going to get rid of it .
we are bringing education to a local level .
one thing on education .
so , in the world , we are _UNK_ number _UNK_ there are third world countries that are _UNK_ better than us in education and many other things .
and yet , per _UNK_ , we are number 1 , by far _UNK_ there is nobody close .
number two isn’t even close .
so we spend more money for _UNK_ than any country in the world and we are _UNK_ number _UNK_ which is way down at the bottom , essentially .
i mean , it’s _UNK_ can you imagine we are _UNK_ number _UNK_ and we are number 1 ?
and that’s what i do like saying about my campaign , i spent less money than anybody else and i have the best results .
i’m number one by a lot and i spent no money .
i mean , my plane cost me some money , but i spent no ads .
took a little radio ad in iowa .
but i didn’t do that _UNK_ i took _UNK_ i think the station is so _UNK_ if you want to know the truth .
but i spent essentially no money .
and then you have all these other guys spending vast _UNK_ and they like the way the united states is run .
now , why would we put a guy like _UNK_ , like some of the others .
it’s not only _UNK_ bush .
they spend money .
i see _UNK_ on the ads all day long .
you know , the black background .
he’s got like a black thing .
he should have put something like that behind him , right ?
right there , the flag .
no , no .
and i like him .
i think he is a nice guy .
but i see these ads with the backdrop and it is just _UNK_ .
it’s not _UNK_ i don’t think it’s good .
so , think of it .
i spent no money and i’m number one .
others spent _UNK_ they will have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and they are not even in the race .
that’s what we need for our country .
what ?
_UNK_ i’ve got 15,000 , i don’t know what the hell he means by that but that’s _UNK_ so , but i think he’s a fan .
i don’t think he’s a _UNK_ are you a _UNK_ ?
no .
_UNK_ no body likes trump .
_UNK_ he’s not a _UNK_ .
i love you .
you know , the only time _UNK_ don’t worry about it .
the only time the cameras focus on the crowd is when we have a _UNK_ .
cause i always have _UNK_ like , look at this room , _UNK_ .
i always have the biggest crowds .
and i go home and my wife said were there many people ?
i watched you on television tonight .
i said , i had 20,000 people .
she said , they didn’t show it .
they have it right on your face .
so i have 20,000 people .
i have 20,000 in oklahoma , _UNK_ in mobile , alabama .
nobody knows .
because those cameras stay right in your face and i think they can’t move .
you know , i think they might be fixed because modern cameras maybe _UNK_ except every time there is a guy that stands up _UNK_ , you know , they are on drugs or something , cause some of those guys , it’s like .
they don’t even know what the hell they are doing there , all the sudden , the cameras _UNK_ and make perfect shots .
and i like it because then it shows how big the crowds are .
so , you know .
some time i think i’m going to put in some false protesters .
i’ll put in some friendly protesters .
it’s the only way i’m going to be able to get the crowd in .
so when we started , i talked about trade .
i talked about the border .
i talked about a lot of things .
and i started on june _UNK_ and _UNK_ in trump tower , the famous _UNK_ ride .
and it takes _UNK_ to run for president .
i’ll tell you , you know , it’s like , i’ve never did this before .
and , you know , then they tell you on a debate we had the largest debate .
we have the largest audience in the history of cable television .
then cnn a couple of weeks later had 23 million .
fox had 24 million .
cnn had 23 million _UNK_ the largest audience in the history of cnn .
now , they’re there _UNK_ the cameras are on live right now .
i mean , you know .
so , the largest audience in the history of ( inaudible ) .
now , the debates used to be , if you go back four years or eight years , you know , whenever the cycles came up , nobody even wanted _UNK_ they didn’t want the debates .
i think they were forced to take them for _UNK_ .
nobody wanted the debates .
they drew nothing , but now they’re drawing 24 million .
now they want to have more debates _UNK_ `` oh , can we have more ?
can we have more ? ''
can they go three hours ?
do you remember when they had the one go three hours ?
i said , no , i’m not doing three hours .
it’s too long .
who wants _UNK_ i could stand up here for 50 hours , but who the hell wants to sit home watching three hours of the stuff , right ?
`` mr. trump , you have 30 _UNK_ .
what would you do about isis ? ''
oh , great .
and by the way , that question _UNK_ i hate those questions .
you know why ?
because i want to be _UNK_ .
i don’t want to tell isis what i’m going to do to knock the hell out of them .
remember , i said very strongly _UNK_ ( inaudible ) the oil for what , four years ?
you’ve been watching .
i mean , four years .
i’ve been `` get the oil , get the oil , get the oil . ''
because who’s going to get the oil ?
iran is taking over iraq .
we made a deal for iran , done by some of the _UNK_ people on earth , on our side .
we gave them everything .
they _UNK_ we don’t even get our prisoners back .
and now iran wants to start negotiating _UNK_ for them .
can you believe it ?
i go _UNK_ .
we would have gotten them back .
all you had to do was say , `` we want our prisoners back . ''
they would have said no .
i would have said , `` i want them back ; you don’t understand me .
i want them back . ''
they would have said , `` no , we won’t do that . ''
i would have said , `` _UNK_ , '' and i would have left .
then i would have doubled up the sanctions .
and i guarantee you ... ... i guarantee you that within 24 hours , they would have called back and they’ll say , `` you’ve got your prisoners ; can we talk ? ''
and i would have never given them $ 150 billion .
i would have never given them the money .
i would have never give _UNK_ they’re using it _UNK_ they don’t have to make nuclear .
they can buy it .
why are they going to make it ?
then we have the nuclear , where they have _UNK_ inspections .
how about the area _UNK_ you know , the big area ?
they don’t want us there .
oh , i wonder why .
they don’t want us there .
so they _UNK_ , _UNK_ ?
then they have the _UNK_ _UNK_ , but the _UNK_ is the beauty .
`` we think you’re making nuclear weapons here . ''
`` well , let us go check , mr. president , we’ll check . ''
`` no , sir , we’re not making nuclear weapons .
nobody _UNK_ no , we’re not ; we would never do a thing like that . ''
these are people that have _UNK_ us .
they’ve _UNK_ to us .
they’re a terrorist state .
but _UNK_ and i used to say it’s the worst deal that i’ve ever seen negotiated .
and by the way , just to finish prisoners .
so they’d come back ; we get our prisoners .
but then when i hear the other day that now this deal is done .
it’s all done .
and now i hear they want to negotiate to get _UNK_ and what do they say ?
they said very strongly , they said , `` we are going to want a lot for the prisoners .
that’s out _UNK_ we’re starting off ; we’re going to want a lot . ''
now , we’ve already taken off the sanctions .
they’re already rich as hell .
what _UNK_ what’s going on there ?
that’s why i say , i mean , some people say it’s worst than _UNK_ .
there’s something going on that we don’t know about .
i mean , honest .
and you almost think _UNK_ i’m not saying that , and i’m not a _UNK_ person .
as you said , `` we are ; we’re saying it . ''
half the people in this room are saying it .
i’m trying to be _UNK_ you know , i’m just hoping they’re just _UNK_ people , _UNK_ ?
which they are .
or there’s something going on .
because it’s _UNK_ it’s _UNK_ .
you know , do you ever see where some things are so bad that it can’t be _UNK_ that nobody can do what they did , right ?
nobody .
so , iran now wants to negotiate _UNK_ for the ( inaudible ) .
in other words , that deal is done ; now we want to start all over again .
and they want a lot .
`` we want a lot . ''
and i just _UNK_ i want to just shoot the television , you know ?
because they would have had it just by saying .
and , you know , when they asked kerry and obama , the deal was made .
everybody knows it’s a _UNK_ deal .
it’s going to need to _UNK_ it’s going to lead to tremendous nuclear proliferation , and they’re so rich now .
you know , they became _UNK_ $ 150 billion _UNK_ they became so rich .
and many other things that you don’t even know about .
most people don’t even know what the agreement says .
but i’ll tell you what , when you look at what we’re doing , we’re not going to have _UNK_ if we keep going like this , folks , we’re not going to have a country left .
we’re not going to have a country .
we’re not going to have a country .
and we’re like a _UNK_ ground for the world .
we’re a _UNK_ ground .
they want to take these _UNK_ _UNK_ the _UNK_ , you know , and i feel terrible about the _UNK_ , caused by hillary clinton and barack obama .
they’re the ones that caused it .
they go into libya .
they knocked the hell out of _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , so _UNK_ _UNK_ they backed _UNK_ who end up killing the ambassador and the other young people .
you know the ambassador was _UNK_ in a _UNK_ , one of our _UNK_ , of course , a military _UNK_ , holding the libyan flag and you know , freedom , freedom , freedom .
and then gets killed by the same people .
so , we backed people that turned out to be far worse than _UNK_ .
look at what we did in iraq .
look at what we did in iraq .
i mean , what the hell did we get ?
we spent $ 2 trillion , and that was as a year and a half ago .
i keep saying two or three , it’s a lot more than that .
we spent $ 2 trillion , we have thousands of deaths , and i’m not even talking other side .
you are talking about hundreds of thousands , maybe millions .
you have thousands of deaths .
we have wounded warriors , who i love , all of .
these guys are the toughest _UNK_ these are the greatest people .
you know , these are the greatest people .
and then what happens ?
we leave , and we have a president that _UNK_ the date of when we are leaving .
so , i said , man , if i’m the enemy , i’m just going to go wait for 18 months right ?
he gave a date .
we are leaving iraq , we will be gone by such and such a time .
i said , i’m just sitting there watching and i’m saying , man , that’s really _UNK_ .
because , believe me , the enemy doesn’t want to be killed .
you know , you hear so much , oh they want to go with the _UNK_ up to wherever they go , right ?
they don’t .
they want to live .
and they want to take care of their families , always their families .
you remember that , because their families know what’s going on _UNK_ ?
you think their wives don’t know what they are planning ?
you think their kids don’t know exactly what _UNK_ is doing when _UNK_ is going to fly into the world trade center ?
you think they don’t know ?
they know exactly what’s going on .
remember that .
and frankly , i think they have more love for their family’s lives than they do for their own lives , _UNK_ but they still want to live .
so here is obama , gives an _UNK_ date .
he gives an _UNK_ date and so they pull back .
and everyone says , oh , we are doing so well .
look , we’re doing so well .
why should they fight when they know , in 18 months , they can go in and take the place ?
so what happens ?
so we have isis taking a lot of oil .
i said take the oil .
remember when we left , i was opposed to going in because i said you’re going to _UNK_ the middle east .
because you had iraq and you had iran .
and i said , they fight , they’re always fighting for decades and decades , for generations .
they fight , that’s what they do .
they fight .
how we ever got involved in this mess is hard to believe .
they fight and they were equal _UNK_ .
they go this way , 10 feet .
they go this way , 10 feet .
then they rest a couple of years , then they start fighting again .
then saddam hussein _UNK_ a little gas .
everyone goes _UNK_ .
oh , it’s because ( _UNK_ ) of gas .
they go back and forth .
it’s the same .
and they were stabilized .
and i said , if you go after one or the other , in this case iraq , you’re going to _UNK_ the middle east .
that’s what going to happen .
you’re going to _UNK_ the middle east .
and that’s exactly what happened .
we _UNK_ _UNK_ the middle east .
we have now _UNK_ , largely because of what’s happened _UNK_ .
you know iraq was _UNK_ .
it was _UNK_ to go in and we should have never gone in .
but we shouldn’t have gotten out the way we went out .
and we shouldn’t have given _UNK_ .
i mean , i would have probably said we are going to stay forever .
and they would have said , oh , man .
and then keep going , keep going and eventually they would get tired and say , this guy is _UNK_ .
i mean , he’s never going to leave and you’ll make a deal .
but when you announce you are leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said , they just pull back .
and then as soon as we left , they come in _UNK_ ?
so they have the oil .
you know who the biggest _UNK_ of the oil is right ?
china .
always china .
i love china .
i love mexico .
their leaders are too smart for us .
we have no border .
we will build a wall .
mexico will pay for the wall by the way .
we’re building a wall , we are going to have a border .
and people are going to come into our country , but they are going to come in through a legal process .
they’re not coming in the way they’re coming in now , just walking in like nothing .
they are going to come in , but they are going to come through a legal process .
so , with iraq , so we give them the date and they take over .
we didn’t take the year .
so for four years , i have been talking about it .
then because of paris , all of sudden they start bombing the oil .
but i didn’t want to just bomb the oil .
i wanted to take oil .
they’re bombing .
you know , we are bombing .
great .
what’s going to happen after that ?
so we’re bombing .
and , you know , we are not really bombing it , because they are still selling it .
i said , how could they keep selling it ?
obama does not want to hit them too hard because he is afraid he is going to _UNK_ the atmosphere .
no , this is serious .
now think of it .
he talks about the carbon _UNK_ and yet he will fly a very old air force one , an old _UNK_ _UNK_ , with the old engines and you know , _UNK_ stuff .
so , he’s got a problem with the carbon _UNK_ .
you can’t use hair _UNK_ because hair _UNK_ is going to affect the _UNK_ .
i’m trying to figure out .
let’s see , i’m in my room in new york city and i want to put a little _UNK_ so that i can _UNK_ _UNK_ right ?
right ?
but i hear where they don’t want me to use hair _UNK_ , they want me to use the pump because the other one which i really like better than going _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ and then it comes out in big _UNK_ , right , and you _UNK_ it’s stuck in your hair and you say oh my god , i’ve got to take a _UNK_ again .
my _UNK_ all _UNK_ up , right ?
i want to use hair _UNK_ .
they say don’t use hair _UNK_ , it’s bad for the _UNK_ .
so i’m sitting in this _UNK_ apartment , this _UNK_ unit _UNK_ you know , i really do live in a very nice apartment , right ?
but it’s _UNK_ , it’s beautiful .
i don’t think anything gets out .
and i’m not supposed to be using hair _UNK_ .
but think of it .
so _UNK_ always talking about the global warming , that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem , _UNK_ ?
no , no , think of it .
i mean , even if you’re a _UNK_ in global warming , isis is a big problem , russia’s a problem , _UNK_ a problem .
we’ve got a lot of problems .
by the way , the _UNK_ in north korea is a problem .
he actually has nuclear weapons , right ?
that’s a problem .
we’ve got a lot of problems .
we’ve got a lot of problems .
that’s right , we don’t win anymore .
he said we want to win .
we don’t win anymore .
we’re going to win a lot _UNK_ if i get elected , we’re going to win a lot .
we’re going to win so much _UNK_ we’re going to win a lot .
we’re going to win a lot .
we’re going to win so much you’re all going to get sick and tired of winning .
you’re going to say oh no , not again .
i’m only _UNK_ .
you never get tired of winning , right ?
never .
but think of it .
so _UNK_ talking about all of this with the global warming and the _UNK_ a lot of it’s a _UNK_ , it’s a _UNK_ .
i mean , it’s a _UNK_ industry , _UNK_ ?
it’s a _UNK_ , a lot of it .
and look , i want clean air and i want clean water .
that’s my global _UNK_ i want clean , clean _UNK_ water and i want clean air .
and we can do that , but we don’t have to destroy our businesses , we don’t have to destroy our _UNK_ and by the way , china isn’t abiding by anything .
they’re buying all of our coal ; we can’t use coal anymore essentially .
they’re buying our coal and they’re using it .
now when you talk about the planet , it’s so big out there _UNK_ we’re here , they’re there , it’s like they’re our next door neighbor , right , in terms of the universe .
miss universe , by the way , i made a great deal when i sold _UNK_ oh did i get rich .
that was a great deal .
you know , they broke my _UNK_ on that .
they said he talks about illegal immigration , we’re not going to put him on television .
first of all , _UNK_ is being _UNK_ like _UNK_ ; you wouldn’t believe it .
and _UNK_ , i made a great deal with them , just like an amazing deal , far more than i would have ever gotten _UNK_ i mean , i made an _UNK_ deal _UNK_ far more than i ever would have gotten if i said i think i’m going to sell it if times were normal , right ?
isn’t it amazing the way that stuff can work out ?
but i love miss universe and i love the universe .
but think of it .
so china is _UNK_ up all this stuff and we’re holding back .
and with china _UNK_ you know , we signed these agreements where we have to do it now , they have to do it within 30 or 35 years .
i don’t think they’re going to be doing it .
it’s like japan .
if somebody attacks japan , we have to immediately go and start world war _UNK_ , _UNK_ ?
if we get attacked , japan doesn’t have to help us .
somehow , that doesn’t sound so fair .
does that sound good ?
so south korea _UNK_ i order _UNK_ , i order thousands of _UNK_ a year .
i order _UNK_ because i have a lot of stuff and i like nice brand new _UNK_ they’re all made in south korea , most _UNK_ other than sony , and sony , in all fairness , has lost its way .
but a lot of them _UNK_ _UNK_ , all of them .
i mean , they’re all pretty much _UNK_ all of them , right ?
i think just about .
but i order thousands of _UNK_ , they’re all from south korea .
so we have _UNK_ people on the border _UNK_ south korea from this _UNK_ in north korea , we get nothing .
what do _UNK_ we get nothing .
they’re making a fortune .
it’s an economic _UNK_ .
a lot of you don’t know we protect germany .
germany !
_UNK_ _UNK_ , how many people have a _UNK_ _UNK_ ?
we protect germany .
it’s an economic _UNK_ .
we protect saudi arabia .
they were , during the good oil days _UNK_ now it’s probably half , which is fine .
but during the good old _UNK_ they were making a billion _UNK_ listen to this _UNK_ a billion dollars a day , and we protect them .
our military _UNK_ they pay us _UNK_ , like nothing .
and then if we want to buy _UNK_ we want to move to another _UNK_ , well , that’s very expensive if we do that .
we want _UNK_ they charge us _UNK_ ?
i mean , look .
we are run by people that are so bad , they’re so out of their league _UNK_ and i see it , i see it on the stage .
you know , they’re _UNK_ a lot of them are nice people .
you know , a lot of people think i don’t like these people .
i do like them .
but they don’t have business sense , they don’t have business ability , they don’t have common sense .
they’re politicians , they’re all talk , they’re no action .
when i say ... ... folks , when i say , `` we’re going to build a wall . ''
most of them say , `` you can’t build a wall _UNK_ build a wall . ''
in china 2,000 years ago , they built the great wall of china , which is bigger than any wall we’re thinking about , _UNK_ ?
the great wall of china goes _UNK_ miles .
we have 2,000 miles of which we only need 1,000 miles , because you have a lot of natural barriers , right , that are extremely tough to get across .
we have 1,000 miles .
so , china has _UNK_ or _UNK_ miles , and we have 1,000 miles .
we have modern _UNK_ .
we have _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ i want to use _UNK_ ; i don’t want to use _UNK_ .
made in america .
even my _UNK_ , they’re made in america .
it wasn’t easy to find a guy that could do those _UNK_ .
you know what i’m talking about .
i see so many _UNK_ of my _UNK_ , right ?
`` make america great again . ''
i see these things that are out of _UNK_ .
they’re out of all sorts of _UNK_ .
mine are made in america .
and honestly , they do a great job , but they don’t produce as many as i’d like because , frankly , there’s a big _UNK_ i mean , it’s amazing .
those _UNK_ are amazing .
but i wanted to have it made .
and you know why i wanted it _UNK_ i wanted it , anyway , but i also knew that as soon as the _UNK_ came out , and other things _UNK_ we have a website _UNK_ as soon as the _UNK_ came out , i knew the press would be calling .
and it’s true .
first hour when the _UNK_ were announced , i get a call from the new york times .
`` mr. trump , where are those _UNK_ made ? ''
i said , `` america . ''
i knew it .
i knew it .
because as you know , if i would have said china , i would have been in big , big trouble .
but they’re being knocked off all over the world .
i mean , i see _UNK_ _UNK_ they’re like _UNK_ .
i see them all .
but what are you going to do ?
but here’s the story .
we’ve got to build a wall .
so when i talk and when i’m up on the stage with these guys , these people _UNK_ wonderful people _UNK_ and a very nice woman , _UNK_ .
she’s a nice woman .
when i’m up on the stage with them , they think i’m _UNK_ when i say `` mexico '' _UNK_ i’m saying , `` we’re going to build a wall ; it’s going to be a great wall ; it’s going to be real wall .
see this ceiling ?
this ceiling is _UNK_ compared to the height of the wall i’m talking about . ''
i’m talking about a _UNK_ to get up there .
they’re not coming down because it’s too dangerous .
all right ?
did you ever see what they do now ?
we have these little walls .
they build _UNK_ .
they build a ramp .
i say , `` wouldn’t it be cheaper just to knock the wall down and just ... '' and then they drive over it with _UNK_ _UNK_ up with drugs .
do you see this ?
they build _UNK_ .
there was a picture in time magazine .
it’s a ramp _UNK_ a little ramp that goes over the wall .
so , they have a _UNK_ _UNK_ over , down , _UNK_ , make money .
we get the drugs .
think of it .
we _UNK_ `` build a wall '' is right .
you’ve got to build a wall .
we get the drugs .
they get the cash .
no so good , right ?
we don’t like that deal .
our politicians don’t know _UNK_ they don’t know .
so when i say `` mexico’s going to pay for it , '' these guys on the stage with me , they’re not business people .
they don’t understand .
mexico makes a fortune off the united states .
number one , we give them a lot of money .
but in addition to that , they’re taking our businesses .
they’re making _UNK_ you talk about a trade deficit .
i’ll tell you what , mexico in a certain way is in a _UNK_ the new china .
mexico is making an absolute fortune _UNK_ _UNK_ , compared to the cost of the wall .
let’s say the cost of the wall is $ 10 billion .
that’s a good _UNK_ i can do great job at $ 10 billion .
i think we’ll have a lot of money left over .
somebody else would _UNK_ and by the way , 20 years ago , they wanted to build a wall .
people that are opposed to it now , they wanted to stop and they wanted to build a wall .
you know one of the reasons they didn’t build the wall ?
because of the environmental protection agency , they couldn’t get an environmental impact study approved .
can you believe it ?
because there was a _UNK_ or a _UNK_ or a _UNK_ or something was in the way .
now , think of it .
in china , in the south china sea , there were these _UNK_ land _UNK_ that were covered by water , but pretty close to the top .
china sends in massive _UNK_ and they’re ( inaudible ) .
they’re building military _UNK_ in the south china sea .
and a friend of mine , who is one of the biggest and _UNK_ people in china _UNK_ he’s a great guy .
they’re great people .
they’re fine .
they’re just too smart .
i mean , the leaders are too smart for our people .
they won’t be too smart when i put my people there .
when they call up , `` we’d like to speak to the _UNK_ that is negotiating it . ''
`` no , no .
the _UNK_ now is carl _UNK_ .
you’re going to speak to carl _UNK_ . ''
you know carl _UNK_ great _UNK_ .
you have so many people _UNK_ they call all these business people _UNK_ call .
so , a friend of mine , so i call him , i say , `` you’re actually doing that . ''
and then _UNK_ , i said , `` how long did it take to get started ?
did you have to get an environmental impact study approved in order to _UNK_ ? ''
he looked at me , goes , `` i _UNK_ i hope you’re _UNK_ when you say that .
they _UNK_ of the idea and they started _UNK_ four hours later , _UNK_ ?
there is no , you know , go through 25 years of environmental impact , you are going to hurt the _UNK_ .
you’re going to hurt this .
you are going to _UNK_ they are doing a big thing .
they _UNK_ _UNK_ massive , massive _UNK_ take a look , massive .
the biggest _UNK_ .
they are _UNK_ the hell out of that ocean .
they are _UNK_ it and they are taking their _UNK_ and they are putting it _UNK_ and they’re building air fields and they’re building _UNK_ .
we couldn’t do it because , just like i said for the law .
_UNK_ , they could not get an environmental impact statement .
now , that’s probably not the only reason it didn’t happen .
i heard their costs were too high .
with me , that’s easy .
you know , i’m doing the old post office or watch ( _UNK_ ) you ( _UNK_ ) .
i’m under budget , i’m ahead of schedule .
hey , look at the campaign .
the _UNK_ at $ _UNK_ million and he’s down at the bottom .
i’m nothing and i’m at the top .
it’s the same thing .
i actually said _UNK_ it’s funny .
the other day i got this great review .
they said trump is a great speaker .
the crowd is _UNK_ .
but he has one problem .
and i’m reading , and i want to see .
the problem is , he speaks through the applause .
in other words , like i say that , you applaud , i start talking you finish your applause .
and you know why ?
because i’m so excited , because we have so much potential .
it’s true .
i don’t want to wait for your _UNK_ applause .
we have _UNK_ i have so many _UNK_ we have so much potential .
there are so many things to do .
i don’t really sort of want to wait .
i want to do it .
and i just noticed , i did it again .
you were getting ready to give a big applause , because you like that , and i’m speaking .
i killed the applause .
but he is right .
but except , i’m not a speaker .
what i am is a _UNK_ .
i get things done .
so , when the people up on the stage with me _UNK_ and hillary , hillary doesn’t have a _UNK_ .
by the way , you talk about low energy .
she has lower energy than _UNK_ bush , which is hard to believe .
she does .
and i’ll tell you and i’ve been saying it .
and maybe it’s _UNK_ , maybe it is not .
but it doesn’t matter .
we have a much bigger problem .
we have to save our country .
so , if i’m _UNK_ and if people think i’m _UNK_ _UNK_ i’m actually a nice person .
i have a big heart .
i want to help people .
i want to help the _UNK_ .
i want to do a safe zone in syria .
i don’t want them coming here .
we don’t know who these people are .
they are undocumented .
and we should do a safe zone over there .
we should have the gulf states _UNK_ saudi arabia and these states they are not spending .
they have got to spend .
they have to pay .
you know , we are protecting them .
we’re doing _UNK_ they wouldn’t be there for two minutes if we weren’t protecting them .
they have to start paying .
they are not taking anybody , _UNK_ ?
how about germany taking millions of _UNK_ .
can you believe what she is doing to that country ?
and she was the person of the year and i wasn’t .
everybody said trump was supposed to .
( _UNK_ ) hey , what are you going to do .
i think she has made a terrible mistake .
we will find out .
time will tell .
they have tremendous crime problems .
i think she has made a tremendous mistake .
but what i like is in syria , with other people’s money , meaning the gulf states and others and germany and others .
because , look , germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people .
they’ll give us the money .
we do a massive safe zone .
and then eventually when this whole catastrophe _UNK_ out , which i will probably be able to get it _UNK_ out , i understand this now .
but once it’s _UNK_ out , they could go home to their country , you know , to their area .
it is interesting , i have thousands of people that work for me .
thousands .
and i have people that come from far _UNK_ they are all here legally , don’t worry about it .
i use _UNK_ verify .
but i have people _UNK_ oh , they go and check .
these guys go check .
they went into the old post office _UNK_ everybody who walked their dog , are you hear illegally ?
they said they found one person out of hundreds and hundreds .
i don’t believe it .
but , you know , it is possible somebody _UNK_ _UNK_ hey , we do have 11 million people in the country .
and it is probably a much higher number than that , _UNK_ ?
it is probably a much higher number .
but we have to do something about it and we are going to .
so , i just want to finish by saying this .
look , we have a situation that is out of control .
our country is a _UNK_ ground for the rest of the world .
we are _UNK_ at by the rest of the world .
and when i started this journey , and it is a journey , and i do love you people .
you’re amazing people .
and by the way , you are so smart .
a lot of times , they will say , well mr. _UNK_ people are _UNK_ .
i love _UNK_ .
i’m honored by that .
but they are not _UNK_ .
we have _UNK_ and we have executives and we have young people .
they say the audience is old .
it’s not older .
the audience is young .
the other night in iowa , i told that , and i said , we have so many young people and the place _UNK_ .
they are all young people .
we have an amazing thing happening , it’s just ... look , that’s their way of _UNK_ , not even me , they are _UNK_ you .
it is _UNK_ .
but when i started this journey and that’s what it is , it’s a journey and it’s a movement that’s taking place .
it’s a movement .
remember the old days ?
silent majority ?
it’s not right .
it’s a noisy majority .
people are angry .
it’s a noisy majority .
these aren’t silent people anymore .
i go to people _UNK_ you can’t even hear .
this is an amazing thing that’s happened .
i received a call from one of the biggest reporters , who happens to be liberal , but that’s _UNK_ ( inaudible ) a couple of them , right ?
but , a guy who’s really respected , recently , and he said , `` how does it feel ? ''
i said , `` how does what feel ? ''
he said , `` what you have done has never been done in the history of politics in the united states . ''
i mean , even cnn said , `` number one political story of the year is trump . ''
you know what number two was ?
isis _UNK_ isis was two .
i’d rather reverse it .
let isis be one ; let me be two , because i want to knock the hell out of them and make me number one next year .
make me number one next year .
but this reporter , who is a great intellect , actually , and a very smart guy , very good guy .
he said _UNK_ he said , `` what you’ve done has never been done before in the history of this country . ''
newt gingrich was on a television show the other say , and said , `` this is one the great _UNK_ ( _UNK_ ) i’ve ever seen in politics ; _UNK_ ever seen it . ''
crowds like this ?
forget it .
i mean , it’s only _UNK_ to this ( inaudible ) .
again , they sent 3,000 people home .
can you believe it ?
more than _UNK_ it’s _UNK_ it’s _UNK_ what’s happening .
it’s beautiful what’s happening .
it’s beautiful what’s happening .
but newt gingrich said he’s never seen anything like this .
but he said to me , the reporter , he said , `` never been done before . ''
i said , `` well , you know , it’s fine , but if i don’t win , it’s just a waste of time . ''
he goes , `` no , no , no .
what you’ve done is incredible . ''
he said , `` even if you don’t win , what you’ve done is incredible ; you’ve _UNK_ changed the landscape of politics . ''
no , don’t applaud , don’t applaud , don’t applaud .
he said , `` you’ve _UNK_ changed the landscape of politics ; it’s forever going to be different .
your campaign _UNK_ there’s never been anything like it . ''
_UNK_ , he was very nice .
i said , `` you don’t understand .
you don’t understand .
if i don’t win , i will consider this '' _UNK_ and i mean this _UNK_ `` a total and complete waste of time . ''
i really do .
so _UNK_ because we’re not going to do anything .
it’s wonderful .
oh , good , i had nice crowds .
they’ll write about me every once in a while ; every two years i’ll have a story , `` trump ran this rather good campaign . ''
if we don’t win , to me , and honestly you should feel the same thing , if we don’t win , it’s a terrible waste of time , because you’ll have somebody else in there .
they won’t be able to do what i do .
they’re not going to be able to .
and even if you get one of these republicans in , like , i didn’t finish the _UNK_ so , the wall .
when i say `` mexico is going to pay , '' they all _UNK_ .
they all go `` _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ . ''
they think it’s funny .
honestly , these are people _UNK_ they think it’s funny .
they’re _UNK_ .
you know , lightly , like `` oh _UNK_ , that’s so funny ; _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ . ''
they’re going to pay for the wall , folks .
they’re making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with mexico .
the wall is _UNK_ .
they’re going to pay for the wall .
but i mention it , now they don’t _UNK_ because they’re starting to agree with me .
and then the other day , one of the people said _UNK_ it was ted cruz , who is a nice guy .
but he said , `` we’re going to build a wall at the southern border . ''
i said , `` look '' _UNK_ and my wife is sitting ( inaudible ) _UNK_ where did that come from , right ?
no , ted’s a good guy .
but he said on one of _UNK_ i think it was on fox , he was being _UNK_ .
and he said , `` we’re going to build a wall at the southern border . ''
he didn’t say mexico was going to pay was going to pay .
he hasn’t gone that far yet , but believe me that’s going to happen .
see , they’re all trying to catch up with me .
because when i did this stuff , it was very out there .
now , i’m the one that everybody wants to sort of aspire to .
but what happens is _UNK_ so ted’s up and he’s talking .
and , you know , _UNK_ we’re going to have the border ; we’re going to have this and that .
and we’re going to build a wall .
my wife is sitting there .
she says , `` _UNK_ , did you hear that ?
he just said they’re going to build a wall .
that’s the first time i’ve _UNK_ you know , that’s what you say . ''
she hasn’t heard that from any other candidate .
_UNK_ so we’re going to build a wall .
mexico is going to pay for it .
there are so many things we’re going to do .
but when i _UNK_ when i started the journey , it was amazing .
i came down _UNK_ it took courage .
i went down in to the lobby of trump tower , on the _UNK_ with _UNK_ .
i have never seen _UNK_ it looked like the academy _UNK_ , the press .
we have a lot of press here today .
they’re all live _UNK_ look at all those live cameras .
so when i came down _UNK_ when i came down on the _UNK_ , we came down .
and i said , `` we’re going to do things . ''
and i mentioned illegal immigration .
you wouldn’t even be talking about illegal _UNK_ it wasn’t even on the _UNK_ .
nobody was talking about illegal immigration .
is that right ?
now , it’s one of the big _UNK_ .
and that’s why _UNK_ and one of the beautiful polls that came out , and i’m so proud of it , cnn just came out with a poll a couple of , i guess a week ago _UNK_ _UNK_ percent for trump ; second is 16 ; third is 14 ; then _UNK_ so they’re way down .
but on the economy , they give me 55 _UNK_ 55 percent .
that’s with 16 people at the time .
on the budget , i mean , i understand _UNK_ the budget , the economy , i win _UNK_ i win it hands down , all right .
but listen to this .
on illegal immigration , i’m almost at 50 percent .
and on isis , likewise , almost at 50 percent .
so people want to be protected , they want to feel safe .
they need strength , they need _UNK_ , they need _UNK_ .
i don’t want to be tough _UNK_ you know , i know a lot of tough guys but they’re not smart , and they’re the _UNK_ they’re the easiest .
you can be tough , you’ve got to be smart .
let’s start smart first .
you’ve got to be _UNK_ .
you’ve got to be tough because the world is trying to take advantage of us .
so what happens is this .
i came out , i started _UNK_ i did it , i was , oh , that first couple of weeks with illegal immigration and mexico and all of this stuff .
then _UNK_ was killed in san _UNK_ and _UNK_ was killed in los _UNK_ .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , an _UNK_ young man , was killed , just shot right through the head by an illegal immigrant .
_UNK_ was shot by a guy who came in five or six times , shot in the back .
so many great people .
and that’s _UNK_ these are two , so many .
and then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people aren’t paying taxes and all of this stuff , right ?
and all of a sudden , people are coming over , and i say the wall and now they’re starting to say the wall .
we have to be progressive in our thinking .
when i say progressive , i mean like smart .
i’m not talking progressive like a _UNK_ _UNK_ would say , the guy want to tax you .
think of it .
think of it .
this guy wants to raise your taxes to 90 percent .
no , no , think _UNK_ you’ll have to move out of this _UNK_ i love this area , by the way .
i’ve been here many times .
great _UNK_ area , right ?
we love it .
no more _UNK_ if _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ no more _UNK_ .
no , no , you won’t have any _UNK_ anymore .
there won’t be _UNK_ you won’t have any money left to be _UNK_ you’ll be paying it in taxes .
this guy is a total disaster .
and i’m not saying that _UNK_ i’ll tell you why .
you know , hillary said well , i’d like to run against trump , believe me .
this poor chuck todd , meet the press .
his show is dying and he keeps saying do it , do it , but i never liked it .
you know , i just _UNK_ he never treated me fairly .
so i do his show , he gets the highest ratings he’s had in years .
he went from , like _UNK_ believe me , i won’t even give you the numbers , they were massive , the numbers , right ?
i saved his life , and then he goes hillary clinton said that she would most like to run against donald trump .
and yes _UNK_ and they’re looking forward to it .
trust me , the last person _UNK_ she’s already gotten a _UNK_ last night , do you agree ?
she had a tough night .
she had a tough one .
she had a tough night looking at the beauty _UNK_ , _UNK_ ?
so hillary clinton said _UNK_ and here’s chuck todd _UNK_ and he’s a nice guy .
i’m not trying to knock him .
please don’t be _UNK_ , chuck .
but she says she doesn’t like him .
but he doesn’t treat me right .
so he goes the clinton campaign said they’d most like to run against trump , like i’m some kind of a _UNK_ .
so i call him and i say chuck , let me explain something .
when they say they want to run against me , that means they don’t want to run against me , do you understand that ?
do you understand it’s reverse _UNK_ .
they say they want to run against me _UNK_ first of all , i’m winning and tied in the polls now and i haven’t even hit her yet .
but look at what happened to all the guys i hit .
they’re _UNK_ , they’re gone or they’re failing badly , _UNK_ , and they’ll be gone soon .
but hillary clinton _UNK_ think of it .
i say so chuck , report it like properly .
trust me , they don’t want to run against trump .
the last thing she wants in her whole life is _UNK_ this was only _UNK_ i did this in , like , 15 minutes what happened to them , because the husband wants to come and she wants to _UNK_ me of things and the _UNK_ one of the great _UNK_ of the world ?
give me a break .
give me a break .
give me a break .
so the last person she wants to run against is me .
now here’s the story .
look , here’s the story .
it’s very simple .
so i announced _UNK_ and i was talking about trade , i was talking about the wall , i was talking about the borders , i was talking about obamacare , i was talking about the 2nd amendment will be saved , by the way .
the 2nd amendment .
it will be saved .
the 2nd amendment is going to be with us if i’m president .
you know , they’re doing everything .
they want to get rid of the bullets now , they’re doing everything they can _UNK_ think of paris , think of los _UNK_ .
think if you had some guns in paris on the good side , right ?
they had no guns .
paris has the toughest guns in the world , folks .
and france _UNK_ i mean , you get caught with a gun , it’s _UNK_ the only one that has guns are the bad guys .
so they go in these various places , they called the guy the _UNK_ .
he’s a _UNK_ .
i mean , this guy was a _UNK_ .
i call him the guy with the dirty _UNK_ , right ?
they got him so good .
by the way , the french police did a great job and our los _UNK_ police did a _UNK_ job .
they did a great job .
wouldn’t it be wonderful if , let’s see , this guy right here in front of me , he’s a tough guy .
this guy with the _UNK_ , with the _UNK_ head of hair , but he’s a _UNK_ guy right here .
this guy right there , see ?
and that one .
wouldn’t it be nice if they had a gun on their _UNK_ ?
somebody .
him , him , him , so that when they _UNK_ you know what they were doing in paris ?
get over here , boom .
get over here , boom .
your turn , get over here , boom .
one hundred and thirty people with more to follow because there are people that are so badly injured right now in hospitals .
other people are going to die .
same thing over there .
these are people that gave a party in honor of their marriage .
there’s something going on , folks .
it’s wrong .
they gave them a party .
they worked _UNK_ they gave them a party .
she came in on a _UNK_ permit or some _UNK_ and she was radicalized , and he was probably radicalized by her or he was already radicalized .
and people knew that they were radicalized and people in the area knew that they had bombs _UNK_ who the hell doesn’t know ?
you’re their next door neighbor .
and they didn’t want to talk about it .
you’ve got to report these people .
we’ve got a real problem .
you’ve got to report them .
no more _UNK_ .
they didn’t report them , and the reason they didn’t is because they don’t disagree with them so much .
_UNK_ ?
believe me .
it’s not because they were afraid .
you saw the one who wasn’t politically correct to ( _UNK_ ) report them .
they didn’t want to report them .
i mean , give me a break .
so we have to change .
so it started off with me where i was going to talk about trade , i was going to talk about all the things , i was going to talk about the military , building it up .
i was going to do all of this , but after paris and california , and there will be others because they have no fear of us , but after paris and california , it has _UNK_ changed and my poll numbers went up 10 points .
it’s amazing .
they went up 10 points .
i said , `` what , you think it was the debate ? ''
because i did good in the debate .
they said , `` no .
people view you as a tough _UNK_ that’s not going to take this _UNK_ . ''
that’s what it is .
and now i talk about protection .
i talk about _UNK_ trust me .
the trade _UNK_ that’s so easy for me .
i’ve got the greatest guys in the world .
they’re going to come in , they’re going to do a great job .
i’m going to do some myself .
i always talk about ford .
they’re going to built a plant , $ 2.5 billion in mexico .
that’s not going to happen with me .
that stuff is _UNK_ those deals are no good .
_UNK_ leaving .
they’re closing plants all over michigan to build a plant in _UNK_ in mexico .
how the hell does that help us ?
_UNK_ who are the people that think this is a good thing for us ?
and in the meantime , in michigan and other places , we have plants closing all over the place and they’re spending _UNK_ think about a $ 2.5 billion _UNK_ then they’re going to sell cars , trucks and parts into the united states , no tax , no nothing .
i’ll say you don’t have to pay a tax , folks .
and you know what ?
ford will say `` if i ( inaudible ) pay a tax , we’re going to stay in the united states . ''
i mean , it’s very simple .
it’s very simple .
how about two weeks ago , _UNK_ announced a big _UNK_ chicago .
they announced they’re going to leave chicago with one of their big plants and they’re going to move it to mexico .
what’s my statement ?
we’re not eating _UNK_ anymore , right ?
no more .
but i don’t want this .
it’s not going to happen .
then they’re make _UNK_ they’re going to make product and they’re going to sell it into the united states ?
not going to happen .
it’s not going to happen .
and by the way , i’m a free _UNK_ .
i believe _UNK_ we’ve got to be smart .
i mean , we’ve got to get something .
we don’t get anything out of anything .
we don’t get anything .
we lose on everything .
that iran deal was a disaster .
by the way , think of the iran deal for one second .
i always _UNK_ and this came to me two weeks ago .
i don’t know why i didn’t think of it sooner .
very _UNK_ with myself .
the iran deal is the worst deal i’ve ever seen negotiated , _UNK_ ?
i’m wrong .
you know what the worst deal is ?
iran’s a part of that one too .
we gave them iraq .
that’s even better .
think of it .
we gave iran iraq .
iran has the biggest _UNK_ think of it .
they’re going to have the _UNK_ oil _UNK_ if you go to iraq , take a look .
among the largest oil reserves in the world .
we gave them , by _UNK_ iraq and then leaving , because frankly , once we did it we should have kept _UNK_ troops or something , we give iraq .
so not only did they make a great deal in terms of the iran deal that we know having to do with nuclear , we also gave them iraq .
we gave them iraq , that they’ve been after for 100 years .
we handed it to them .
so now , they have the largest oil reserves among _UNK_ in the world .
that’s even better than the original deal .
i mean , whoever is _UNK_ iran is doing a hell of a job .
_UNK_ ?
if that was a stock , you’ve got to buy some .
so we are not going to have deals like that with me .
it’s not going to happen .
we’re going to become rich again , we are going to become safe again and we are going to become strong again .
and ... and you’re going to remember this moment .
this is going to be an important moment for all of us .
the one thing i have to say and i have to ask you to do , go out and vote .
it’s going to be your turn .
number three .
remember , it starts on february 1st with iowa .
we go to new hampshire , then we go to the _UNK_ ( _UNK_ ) , so three weeks .
we’ve got four weeks to go , and then we have three weeks after we start .
no matter what is going on in your life , you have got to out and vote .
because if you don’t , it’s not going to happen .
don’t sit back and say , oh , trump is going to do well .
the more we can win by , you know , the more power we have in a sense , because it is like a mandate .
but you have got to go out and vote .
and i will tell you this .
it has been an honor to be here , i love this area , i love the people here .
it’s been an honor .
but we will make america great again , i promise .
thank you .
( _UNK_ ) thank you very much , everybody .
well , i want to begin by thanking the people of south carolina .
this is a special state .
thank you .
these are special people and we got a little boost last week from a place we all remember -- new hampshire .
we ca n't forget it .
special , special .
we love it .
and they sent us in here with a very good feeling , right ?
very good feeling .
so i really want to thank you and my volunteers .
all of these people -- volunteers and they travel and they -- and i say , `` what are you doing ? ''
and now they 're going to texas and they 're going all over .
some are going to nevada .
i 'll be going to nevada .
we 're making a big speech tomorrow in atlanta and then we 're going right to nevada .
and i think we 're going to do terrific and the _UNK_ 's ( _UNK_ ) going to be very , very exciting .
we expect to do very , very well .
very well ... i want to just say thank you to my family .
it 's been not easy for them .
they do n't see me anymore .
i 'm making speeches all the time and i have a great .
i really have a great family so i just want to thank all of you .
and _UNK_ -- you know we have a hospital ready just in case .
in south carolina we 're going to have a baby .
there 's nothing wrong with that , right ?
so ... could be -- it could be any second .
it could even be before i 'm finished but it 's -- but she insisted on being here .
it was so important to _UNK_ to insist on being here so thank you .
really good and _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
we have a wonderful lieutenant governor who backed us very early in the process .
you know henry , right ?
the lieutenant governor of south carolina .
i will take him over the governor _UNK_ because we won .
we won ... he handle that very _UNK_ .
he 's tough .
he 's very tough .
_UNK_ , eric , _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , say something .
go ahead , please ... _UNK_ trump : just want to say an amazing place -- south carolina .
_UNK_ to my husband .
he was working very hard and he loves you .
we love you and we 're going ahead to nevada .
and we will see what happen ( sic ) .
he would be the best president ... and _UNK_ some very , very wonderful children , _UNK_ .
just say a few words .
i. trump : thank you , south carolina .
this is an amazing , amazing night .
the momentum since the beginning of this campaign has been _UNK_ and that 's because my father 's message _UNK_ so deeply with so many people .
so as our family we 're incredibly proud .
we 're incredibly grateful to each of you so thank you for being here to support us .
and i will say this , my father is an incredibly hard worker and he 'll be working for each and every one of you .
so together we 'll make america great again .
thank you ... thank you very much .
thank you very much .
so i was watching _UNK_ and it was really amazing to be watching what i was watching .
and some of the pundits and overall fair but not too much .
but a number of the pundits said , `` well , if a couple of the other candidates dropped out if you add their scores together it 's going to equal trump . ''
but these _UNK_ -- they 're _UNK_ -- they do n't understand that as people drop out i 'm going to get a lot of those votes also .
you do n't just ... you do n't just add them together .
so i think we 're going to do very , very well .
i think we 're going to do very well .
i want to also congratulate the other candidates .
in particular i have to say ted and _UNK_ did a really good job and they got -- they did quite well as i understand .
no , come on .
just one minute .
come on .
one second , right ?
good .
_UNK_ we go back to war tomorrow morning .
tomorrow morning we 'll be back but i just want to congratulate the other candidates .
there 's nothing easy about running for president , i can tell you .
it 's tough , it 's _UNK_ , it 's mean , it 's vicious , it 's beautiful .
( laughter ) when you win it 's beautiful and we 're going to start -- we are going to start winning for our country .
we 're going to start winning .
because our country does n't win anymore .
does n't win .
we do n't win with the military , we ca n't beat isis .
we have great military but we ca n't beat isis .
we do n't win on trade .
you look at what china 's doing to us , what japan does to us , what mexico is just killing us at the border -- at the border and with trade .
mexico is killing us -- absolutely .
we 'll do the wall .
do n't worry .
we 're going to do the wall .
we 're going to do the wall and by the way , who 's going to pay for the wall ?
mexico 's going to pay for the wall and it 's very easy .
the other politicians come down , `` you ca n't get mexico to pay for the wall . ''
i said , `` 100 percent . ''
we have a $ _UNK_ billion trade deficit with mexico .
the wall is going to cost $ 10 to $ 12 billion , _UNK_ ?
believe me , they will pay .
one of the officials -- actually , one of the _UNK_ from mexico had a news conference .
and he announced that we will not be paying for the wall .
who does mr. trump think he is ?
they came to me -- the press .
these people -- look at all those cameras back there .
the press came to me and they told me that he said that he would not pay for the wall .
do you have a comment ?
i said , `` yes .
the wall just got 10 feet _UNK_ . ''
it 's true .
and i love mexico .
i love mexico , i love china , i love many of these countries that _UNK_ us off because we have leaders that are _UNK_ and do n't know what they 're doing .
i love these countries .
they 're great .
i have thousands and thousands of _UNK_ .
we 're going to nevada .
i lead -- i lead with the _UNK_ .
i 'm leading in every poll with the _UNK_ .
they love me , i love them .
the problem is -- the problem is that the leaders of these countries whether it 's mexico or japan or _UNK_ _UNK_ which is just doing a big number now all of a sudden or china in particular -- that 's the big one .
the greatest abuse of a country that i think i 've ever seen _UNK_ -- china .
what they 've done to us is the greatest single theft in the history of the world .
they 've taken our jobs , they 've taken our money , they 've taken everything .
we 're bringing our jobs back , folks .
we 're bringing our jobs back .
we 're going to bring them back ... and i know how to do it .
we 've had so many -- we 've had so many incredible _UNK_ and to me getting the greatest business people to _UNK_ me is very important .
carl _UNK_ _UNK_ me , so many others have _UNK_ me .
and we 're going to put these great business people in charge of trade and when china wants to come and negotiate , they 're going to negotiate not with a political _UNK_ which is what they have now .
they 're going to negotiate with the best business minds in the world and we have them in this country .
so we 're going to do a lot of beautiful work .
we 're going to _UNK_ obamacare .
it 's going to _UNK_ .
it 's going to be over ... it 's going to be _UNK_ and it 's going to be replaced .
and you 're going to have much better health care at a much smaller cost because obamacare -- if you look -- look at the increases in your obamacare .
_UNK_ , 35 , 45 , even 55 percent .
it 's dead .
it 's not working .
we 're going to go to a plan that 's going to be so much better and so much less expensive .
so second amendment by the way -- this is a room loves the second amendment .
thank you , _UNK_ .
this is a room loves and _UNK_ the second amendment .
we are going to protect our second amendment .
_UNK_ ... common core is gone .
we are getting rid of common core .
we 're _UNK_ education to a local level .
the people in this community -- every time i see them they want education _UNK_ .
the parents , the teachers .
they want to do it -- they do n't want bureaucrats in washington telling them how to educate their children .
we spend as a nation more for education per _UNK_ than any other nation in the world .
not even close .
more per _UNK_ -- second place does n't even exist it 's so different .
and yet out of 30 countries we 're _UNK_ number _UNK_ you have china , you have _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ and then you have number 30 , the united states .
so we spend the most and we 're at the bottom of the _UNK_ .
it 's not going to happen anymore , folks .
it 's not going to happen anymore .
we are going to build our military which i thank because a number of the people came down and a number of the pundits in washington i -- we love our military .
we love our military .
and by the way we love our police .
our police are terrific .
we love our police ... they are not being treated properly .
we 're going to build our military so big , so good , so strong , so powerful that nobody is ever going to mess with us , folks .
and we 're going to buy -- we 're going to buy the equipment that our generals , our soldiers , that everybody that 's in the know want .
we 're not buying equipment that _UNK_ because they have political pull ( _UNK_ ) .
because they take campaign and they give campaign contributions .
we are going to get the equipment that they want , not the equipment that they 're told to have by senators and congressmen in washington .
we 're going to have great equipment .
and the reason i can say that is i 'm _UNK_ my campaign .
i 'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these ... i 'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these special interests and lobbyists and _UNK_ that once they get it they literally do whatever the politicians want .
that 's not going to happen .
and we 're going to take care of our vets .
we love our vets and they 're being treated _UNK_ .
we 're taking care of our vets .
so we 're now off to nevada and it 's a great state .
we have great people .
we have great people in our nation .
no matter where we go -- i went to mobile , alabama -- _UNK_ people .
we went to oklahoma recently twice -- 20,000 people , 20,000 people .
no matter where we go we fill up the _UNK_ .
over here the other day we had a _UNK_ -- we had a 10,000 -- we have people .
the only thing that stops the crowds are the walls because we ca n't get them in .
we have to send thousands of people away .
time magazine -- time magazine last year did an incredible cover story .
they said `` it 's a movement . ''
and that 's what it is .
it 's an incredible movement with incredible people .
incredible people .
it 's an incredible movement with incredible people .
i tell you .
and whether we go -- honestly whether we go to dallas or whether we go anywhere you say -- you go to _UNK_ -- you go anywhere you say .
our people are incredible .
and our _UNK_ -- what 's our _UNK_ ?
you know it , right ?
our _UNK_ which i love may be the greatest _UNK_ of all time , right ?
and the word again eventually is going to come off .
we 're going to get rid of the whole _UNK_ because what 's going to happen -- make america great again , right ?
and the last two weeks because i 've gotten to see so many -- i guess millions when you add them all up with all of these rooms and all of these speeches .
and i 've met so many people .
but the people are so incredible that i 've been saying make america great again and it 's going to be greater than ever before .
that 's the kind of potential we have .
greater then every before .
i don’t see how there is any room for _UNK_ or _UNK_ of the statement i made on june _UNK_ during my presidential announcement speech .
here is what i said , and yet this statement is _UNK_ distorted by the media : '' when mexico ( meaning the mexican government ) sends its people , they’re not sending their best .
they’re not sending you ( pointing to the audience ) .
they’re not sending you ( pointing again ) .
they’re sending people that have _UNK_ of problems , and they’re bringing those problems to us .
they’re bringing _UNK_ bringing crime .
they’re _UNK_ .
and some , i assume , are good people !
but i speak to border guards and they tell us what we’re getting .
and it only makes common sense .
they’re sending us not the right people .
it’s coming from more than mexico .
it’s coming from all over south and latin america , and it’s coming probably from the middle east .
but we don’t know .
because we have no protection and we have no _UNK_ , we don’t know what’s happening .
and it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast . ''
what can be simpler or more _UNK_ stated ?
the mexican government is forcing their most _UNK_ people into the united states .
they are , in many cases , criminals , drug _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
this was _UNK_ just this week when , as an example , a young woman in san _UNK_ was _UNK_ killed by a 5 time _UNK_ mexican with a long criminal record , who was forced back into the united states because they didn’t want him in mexico .
this is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the united states .
in other words , the worst elements in mexico are being pushed into the united states by the mexican government .
the largest suppliers of _UNK_ , _UNK_ and other _UNK_ drugs are mexican cartels that _UNK_ to have mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and _UNK_ in the drugs .
the border patrol knows this .
likewise , tremendous _UNK_ disease is _UNK_ across the border .
the united states has become a _UNK_ ground for mexico and , in fact , for many other parts of the world .
on the other hand , many _UNK_ people come in from mexico and our country is better for it .
but these people are here legally , and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally .
i am proud to say that i know many hard working _UNK_ of them are working for and with me ... and , just like our country , my organization is better for it .
the mexican government wants an open border as long as it’s a one way open border into the united states .
not only are they killing us at the border , but they are killing us on trade ... and the country of mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so .
i have great respect for mexico and love their people and their _UNK_ great spirit .
the problem is , however , that their leaders are far smarter , more _UNK_ , and better negotiators than ours .
to the citizens of the united states , who i will represent far better than anyone else as president , the mexican government is not our friend ... and why should they be when the relationship is _UNK_ one _UNK_ in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade .
i have pointed this out during my speeches and it is something mexico doesn’t want me to say .
in _UNK_ , it was only after my significant rise in the polls that _UNK_ , previously my friend , went ballistic .
i believe that my examples of bad trade deals for the united states was of even more concern to the mexican government than my talk of border security .
i have lost a lot during this presidential run defending the people of the united states .
i have always heard that it is very hard for a successful person to run for president .
_UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ and _UNK_ have all taken the weak and very _UNK_ position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country .
_UNK_ , because 70 % of their business comes from mexico , in my opinion , is being _UNK_ to by the mexican government .
the last thing mexico wants is donald trump as president in that i will make great trade deals for the united states and will have an _UNK_ border -- only legally approved people will come through easily .
_UNK_ , _UNK_ has just announced they are _UNK_ to go public despite very poor and even negative _UNK_ , which is not a good situation for a successful _UNK_ or high stock _UNK_ to mention that i am currently _UNK_ them for breach of _UNK_ .
remember , _UNK_ is the one who began this _UNK_ in the first place , and they are owned by one of hillary _UNK_ biggest _UNK_ .
after the speech was made , there were _UNK_ _UNK_ and indeed , many _UNK_ `` reviews '' _UNK_ was very little criticism .
it wasn’t until a week after my announcement that people started to _UNK_ distort these very easy to understand words .
if there was something stated _UNK_ , it would have been brought up immediately and with great _UNK_ .
the issues i have addressed , and continue to address , are vital steps to make america great again !
_UNK_ , i would be the best jobs president that god ever created .
let’s get to work !
trump : ( _UNK_ ) this was going to be a speech on hillary clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what’s going on , and especially how poor she’d do as president in these very , very troubled times of radical islamic terrorism .
trump : even her former secret service agent , who’s seen her under pressure and in times of stress , has stated that she _UNK_ the _UNK_ and integrity to be our president .
there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time , and i will deliver that speech very , very soon .
but today , there’s only one thing to discuss , the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders .
the attack on the _UNK_ _UNK_ in _UNK_ , florida , was the worst terror strike on our soil since september 11th , and the worst mass shooting in our country’s history .
so many people _UNK_ it’s just hard to believe , but just so many people dead , so many people gravely injured , so much carnage , such a _UNK_ .
the horror is beyond _UNK_ .
the families of these wonderful people are _UNK_ devastated , and they will be forever .
likewise , our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated .
we express our deepest _UNK_ to the victims , the wounded , and their families .
we mourn as one people for our nation’s loss , and pledge our support to any and all who need it .
i would like to ask now that we all _UNK_ a moment of silence for the victims of this attack .
thank you .
our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of _UNK_ _UNK_ community .
they have been through something that nobody could ever experience .
this is a very dark moment in america’s history .
a radical islamic terrorist targeted the _UNK_ , not only because he wanted to kill americans , but in order to execute gay and _UNK_ citizens , because of their sexual orientation .
it’s a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation .
it’s an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives , love who they want , and express their identity .
it’s an attack on the right of every single american to live in peace and safety in their own country .
we need to respond to this attack on america as one united people , with force , purpose , and determination .
but the current politically correct response _UNK_ our ability to talk and to think and act clearly .
we’re not acting clearly , we’re not talking clearly , we’ve got problems .
if we don’t get tough , and if we don’t get smart , and fast , we’re not going to have our country anymore .
there will be nothing , absolutely nothing , left .
the _UNK_ , whose name i will not use , or ever say , was born in afghan , of afghan parents , who _UNK_ to the united states .
his father published support for the afghan taliban , a regime which _UNK_ those who don’t share its radical views , and they murdered plenty .
the father even said he was running for president of afghanistan .
the bottom line is that the only reason the _UNK_ was in america in the first place , was because we allowed his family to come here .
that is a fact , and it’s a fact we need to talk about .
we have a _UNK_ immigration system , which does not permit us to know who we let into our country , and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly .
we have an _UNK_ administration .
and if i’m elected president , that will not change , i will tell you , that will not change over the next four years .
we have an administration that will not change .
but if i get in there , it’s going to change , and it’s going to change quickly .
we’re going from _UNK_ _UNK_ to just the opposite , believe me .
trump : thank you .
with 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded , we can not afford to talk around issues anymore .
we have to address these issues _UNK_ .
i called for a ban after san _UNK_ and was met with great _UNK_ and anger but now many years and i have to say many years but many are saying that i was right to do so .
and although the pause is temporary we must find out what is going on .
we have to do it .
it will be lifted _UNK_ this ban _UNK_ when and as a nation we’re in a position to properly and perfectly _UNK_ these people coming into our country .
they’re _UNK_ in and we don’t know what we’re doing .
the immigration laws of the united states give the president powers to _UNK_ _UNK_ into the country of any class of persons .
now , any class _UNK_ it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the united states .
and it’s as he or she _UNK_ appropriate .
hopefully it’s he in this case .
thank you .
i will use this power to protect the american people .
when i’m elected i will _UNK_ immigration from areas of the world where there’s a proven history of terrorism against the united states , europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats .
after a full ... thank you .
and by the way we have no choice .
after a full and _UNK_ and long _UNK_ really long _UNK_ security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of america .
we can not continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to _UNK_ into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage _UNK_ .
many of the principles of radical islam are incompatible with western values and institutions .
remember this , radical islam is _UNK_ , _UNK_ and _UNK_ american .
i refuse to allow america to become a place where gay people , christian people , jewish people are targets of persecution and _UNK_ by radical islamic _UNK_ of hate and violence .
this is not just a national security issue .
it’s a quality of life issue .
if we want to protect the quality of life for all americans _UNK_ women and children , gay and straight , jews and christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical islam and we need to do it now .
we need to tell the truth also about how radical islam is coming to our shores .
and it’s coming ... with these people , folks , it’s coming .
we’re _UNK_ radical islamic terrorism into the west through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president .
even our own fbi director has _UNK_ that we can not effectively check the backgrounds of people we’re letting into america .
all of the september 11th _UNK_ were issued visas .
large numbers of _UNK_ refugees in minnesota have tried to join isis .
the boston _UNK_ came here through political _UNK_ .
the _UNK_ _UNK_ in san _UNK_ again whose name i will not mention was the child of immigrants from pakistan and he brought his wife , the other terrorist from saudi arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs .
trump : immigration from afghanistan into the united states has increased nearly five _UNK_ _UNK_ five _UNK_ in just one year .
according to _UNK_ research , 99 percent of the people in afghanistan support _UNK_ _UNK_ law .
we admit many more , and that’s just the way it is .
we admit many more from other countries in the region .
and i’ll tell you what : they share these _UNK_ views and values .
we want to remain a free and open society .
then , and if we do , then we have to control our borders .
we have to control , and we have to control them now , not later .
right now .
thank you .
yet hillary clinton , for months , and despite so many attacks , repeatedly refused to even say the words radical islam until i challenged her yesterday .
and , guess what , she will probably say them .
she sort of has said them , but let’s see what happens .
she really has no choice , but she doesn’t want to .
however , she’s really been forced , and she has been forced to say these words .
she supports , and the reason is , she supports so much of what is wrong , and what is wrong with this country , and what’s going wrong with our country and our borders .
she has no _UNK_ , in my opinion , what radical islam is and she won’t speak honestly about it if she does , in fact , know .
she’s in total denial , and her continuing _UNK_ to ever name the enemy _UNK_ weakness across the entire world _UNK_ true weakness .
i don’t know if you know this , but just a few weeks before san _UNK_ , the slaughter , that’s all it was was a slaughter , hillary clinton explained her _UNK_ to say the words `` radical islam . ''
here is what she said , _UNK_ quote , `` muslims are peaceful and tolerant people , and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism . ''
that is hillary clinton .
so , she says the solution is to ban guns .
they tried that in france which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world , and _UNK_ people were _UNK_ murdered by islamic terrorists in cold blood .
her plan is to _UNK_ law abiding americans , _UNK_ the second amendment , and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns .
no good .
not going to happen , folks .
not going to happen .
not going to happen .
thank you .
she wants to take away _UNK_ guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us .
let them come into the country , we don’t have guns .
let them come in , let them have all the fun they want .
i will be meeting with the nra , which has given me their earliest _UNK_ in a presidential race , to discuss how to ensure americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror .
i will be always defending the second amendment .
thank you .
thank you .
the bottom line is that hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical islam into american and allow it to grow _UNK_ , and it is growing .
in fact , hillary _UNK_ catastrophic immigration plan will bring _UNK_ more radical islamic immigration into this country , threatening not only our society but our entire way of life .
when it comes to radical islamic terrorism , ignorance is not _UNK_ .
it’s deadly _UNK_ _UNK_ deadly .
the obama administration , with the support of hillary clinton and others , has also damaged our security by _UNK_ our intelligence gathering and we have , just , no intelligence gathering information .
we need this information so badly , and he stopped it .
we don’t have the support .
we don’t have the support of the law enforcement system because obama is not letting them do their job .
they are not being allowed to do their job .
and , they can do it well _UNK_ better than anybody .
we need a new leader .
we need a new leader fast .
trump : thank you .
they have put political _UNK_ above common sense , above your safety , and above all else .
i refuse to be politically correct .
i want to do the right thing .
i want to _UNK_ things out and i want to make america great again .
the days of deadly ignorance will end , and they will end soon if i’m elected .
as president i will give our intelligence community , law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks .
they don’t have those tools now .
we need an intelligence gathering system second to none .
second to none .
that includes better cooperation between state , local and federal officials , and with our allies , very importantly .
i will have an attorney general , a director of national intelligence and a secretary of defense _UNK_ know how to fight a war on radical islamic terrorism .
and they will have the support that they need to get the job done right , not like it is right now .
it’s not right .
we also must ensure the american people are provided the information they need to understand the threat .
the senate _UNK_ on immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the united states since september 11th .
nearly a year ago , the senate _UNK_ asked president _UNK_ department of justice , state and homeland security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the united states .
these _UNK_ refused to comply .
nobody even knows why .
they refused to comply .
president obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals _UNK_ in terrorist activities of any kind since september 11th .
so important .
the public has a right to know how these people got here , how they came on to this great land , why are they here ?
we have to _UNK_ _UNK_ to know whether they are _UNK_ with or supporting radical groups and beliefs , very simple .
we have to control the amount of future immigration into this country and we have to prevent large pockets of _UNK_ from _UNK_ inside america .
not complicated .
every – and just think of this .
take a look .
every single event , even a single individual can be devastating , and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in _UNK_ and what happened in other cases .
just a single event .
and just one person .
can you imagine what they’ll do in large groups , which we’re allowing now to come here .
truly our president doesn’t know what he’s doing .
he’s failed us and he’s failed us badly .
under his leadership this situation will not get any better , it will only get worse .
and i’ve been saying that for a long time .
each year the united states permanently _UNK_ 100,000 immigrants from the middle east and many more from muslim countries outside of the middle east .
our government has been _UNK_ _UNK_ growing numbers , year after year , without any effective plan for our own security .
in fact , _UNK_ state department was in charge of _UNK_ and the _UNK_ process for people applying to enter from overseas .
having learned nothing from these attacks , she now plans to _UNK_ increase _UNK_ without a screening plan including a 500 percent increase in syrian refugees coming into our country .
tell me , tell me – how _UNK_ is that ?
this could be a better , bigger , more _UNK_ version than the _UNK_ _UNK_ horse ever was .
altogether , under the clinton plan , you’d be _UNK_ hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east with no system to _UNK_ them , or to prevent the _UNK_ of the children and their children .
not only their children , by the way , they’re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful isis is and how wonderful islam is and we don’t know what’s happening .
trump : the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to really to _UNK_ .
we’re not screening people .
so why don’t we have an effective screening system ?
we don’t .
we’re being _UNK_ at all over the world .
the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and _UNK_ americans .
the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us how she will pay for it , her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term .
wouldn’t this be money better spent rebuilding america for our current population including the many poor people already living here .
we have cities , we have inner cities ... we have poverty all over and this is how we’re spending billions of dollars .
we have to stop the tremendous flow of syrian refugees into the united states .
we don’t know who they are , they have no _UNK_ and we don’t know what they’re planning and we won’t unless we have proper _UNK_ and proper leadership in which case they’re out of here .
what i want ... what i want is common sense .
i want a _UNK_ immigration policy that promotes american values .
that’s a choice i put before the american people .
a _UNK_ immigration policy designed to benefit america or hillary _UNK_ radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interests .
that’s all it is .
we’ve got to get smart and tough and vigilant and we’ve got to do it now because later is too late _UNK_ going to be too late for our country .
the media talks about home grown terrorism but islamic _UNK_ and that’s a very , very important term _UNK_ a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that _UNK_ it are imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don’t like it .
yes , there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of poor policies of the past .
but the whole point is that we will be much , much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don’t keep on bringing people who add to the problem .
and that’s what they’re doing .
we’re letting all of these people _UNK_ hundreds of thousands of people come in and all they’re doing is adding to this incredible problem we have .
for instance , the controversial mosque _UNK_ by the boston _UNK_ had at its _UNK_ and as its _UNK_ an immigrant from overseas charged in an _UNK_ plot .
this _UNK_ and _UNK_ in _UNK_ was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth .
why would we admit people who support violent hatred ?
hillary clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women , gays and anyone who doesn’t share their views or values .
she can’t have it both ways .
she can’t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to _UNK_ these same communities .
how does this kind of immigration make our lives better ?
how does this kind of immigration make our country better ?
why does hillary clinton want to bring people in in vast numbers who reject our values ?
why ?
explain .
ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the _UNK_ community , donald trump with actions or hillary clinton with her words ?
trump : i will tell you who the better friend is and some day i believe that will be proven out _UNK_ ( _UNK_ ) .
and by the way the _UNK_ community is just _UNK_ what’s happened to them is just so _UNK_ and to be thinking about where their policies are currently with this administration is a _UNK_ to that community , i will tell you right now .
clinton wants to allow radical islamic terrorists to _UNK_ into our country .
they _UNK_ women , and they murder gays .
i don’t want them in our country .
immigration is a privilege , and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn’t support our communities .
all of our communities , every single one of them .
americans already _UNK_ four times more immigrants than any country on earth , anybody in the world .
four times more .
at least , because we don’t even know who’s coming in .
and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny .
not _UNK_ , wages for our workers haven’t _UNK_ .
in almost 20 years .
you wonder why we get the crowds , you wonder why we get this tremendous support , you wonder why i’ve gotten more votes than any republican in any primary in the history of the republican party ?
take a look at that .
take a look at your security , take a look at the wages .
for 18 years they’ve been stagnant , they’ve even gone down .
so whether it’s a matter of national security , or financial security , we can’t afford to keep on going like this .
can not afford it .
we owe $ 19 trillion in debt .
and no longer have any options .
our communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief .
this is not an act of offense against anyone .
it’s really an act of defense .
i want us all , all of us , to work together .
we have to form a partnership , with our muslim communities .
we have muslim communities in this country that are great , and we have to form that partnership .
now , the muslim community , so important .
they have to work with us .
they have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad .
they know it .
and they have to do it , and they have to do it _UNK_ .
i want to fix our schools .
i want to fix our bridges .
and our jobs market , we’re going to have it rocket again , we’re going to make great trade deals .
but i want every american to succeed including muslims .
but the muslims have to work with us .
they have to work with us .
they know what’s going on .
they know that he was bad .
they knew the people in san _UNK_ were bad .
but you know what ?
they didn’t turn them in .
and you know what ?
we had death , and destruction .
hillary clinton wants to empty out the treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who _UNK_ hate against our citizens .
i want to protect our citizens , all of our citizens .
the terrorist attack on _UNK_ _UNK_ demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault .
in san _UNK_ , as an example , people who knew what was going on , they knew exactly , but they used the excuse of racial _UNK_ for not reporting it .
they said oh , `` we thought so but we didn’t want to use racial _UNK_ . ''
which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer , so they don’t get in trouble .
we need to know what the _UNK_ discussed with his _UNK_ , parents , friends and _UNK_ .
we need to know if he was _UNK_ with any radical mosques or radical activists and what , if any , is their immigration status .
we have to know , and we have to know fast .
we need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with .
we need to know , and we need to make sure , every single last person involved in this plan , including anyone who knew something but didn’t tell us , is brought to justice , so when people know what’s going on and they don’t tell us , and we have an attack , and people die , these people have to have consequences .
big consequences .
america must do more _UNK_ much more _UNK_ to protect its citizens , especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation , as you just saw in _UNK_ .
trump : it also means we must change our foreign policy .
the decision to overthrow the regime in libya , then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in syria , among other things , without plans for the day after , have created space for isis to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before .
these actions , along with our disastrous iran deal , have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our muslim allies in the region .
that is why our new goal must be to defeat islamic terrorism not nation building .
no more nation building .
it’s never going to work .
and by the way we’ve spent almost $ 5 trillion over the years on trying to nation build in the middle east and it has been complete and total disaster .
we’re further away now than we were 15 years ago .
for instance , the last major nato mission was hillary _UNK_ war in libya .
that mission helped to unleash isis on a new continent .
i’ve said nato need to change its focus and stop terrorism .
we have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism .
since i’ve raised that criticism and it’s _UNK_ i’ve gotten no credit for it but these are minor details _UNK_ nato has since announced a new initiative _UNK_ front page of the wall street _UNK_ four days ago focused on just that .
america must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against islamic terrorism .
pretty much like we did with communism during the cold war .
we tried it president _UNK_ way , doesn’t work .
he gave the world his _UNK_ tour .
we got isis and many other problems in return .
that’s what we got .
remember the famous _UNK_ tour .
we’re sorry for everything .
i’d like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our _UNK_ with the people of _UNK_ who have come under this horrific attack .
when i’m president i pledge to protect and defend all americans who live inside our borders .
wherever they come from , wherever they were born , i don’t care .
all americans living here and following our laws not other laws will be protected .
thank you .
thank you .
we’re going to be tough and we’re going to be smart and we’re going to do it right .
america will be a tolerant and open society .
america will also be a safe society .
we will protect our borders at home .
we will defeat isis overseas .
we have no choice .
we will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety .
we will make america rich again .
we will make america safe again .
we will make america great again .
thank you .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you .
thank you very much , everybody .
appreciate it .
thank you .
good evening .
thank you very much .
i speak to you today as a _UNK_ supporter and true friend of israel .
i am a _UNK_ to politics but not to _UNK_ the jewish state .
in late 2001 , weeks after the attacks on new york city , and on washington , and frankly the attacks on all of us , attacks that perpetrated ... and they were perpetrated by the islamic _UNK_ , mayor _UNK_ _UNK_ visited israel to show solidarity with terror victims .
i sent my plane because i backed the mission for israel 100 percent .
in spring of _UNK_ , at the height of the violence in the gaza _UNK_ , i was the grand _UNK_ of the _UNK_ salute to israel parade , the largest single gathering in support of the jewish state .
it was a very dangerous time for israel and frankly for anyone supporting israel , many people turned down this honor .
i did not .
i took the risk and i’m glad i did .
but i didn’t come here tonight to _UNK_ to you about israel .
that’s what politicians do .
all talk , no action , believe me .
i came here to speak to you about where i stand on the future of american relations with our strategic ally , our unbreakable friendship , and our cultural brother .
the only democracy in the middle east , the state of israel .
my number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran .
i have been in business a long time .
i know _UNK_ and let me tell you , this deal is catastrophic , for america , for israel , and for the whole of the middle east .
the problem here is fundamental .
we have rewarded the world’s leading state sponsor of terror with $ 150 billion dollars , and we received absolutely nothing in return .
i’ve studied this issue in great detail .
i would say actually , greater by far than anybody else .
believe me , and it’s a bad deal .
the biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that iran is going to violate it , because already , as you know , it has .
the bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock .
and of course , they’ll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so _UNK_ and _UNK_ gave them .
the deal doesn’t even require iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability .
yes , it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years .
but when those restrictions expire , iran will have an industrial size military nuclear capability ready to go , and with zero provision for delay , no matter how bad iran’s behavior is .
terrible , terrible situation that we are all placed in , and especially israel .
when i’m president , i will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to iran .
first , we will stand up to iran’s aggressive push to _UNK_ and _UNK_ the region .
iran is a very big problem and will continue to be , but if i’m not elected president , i know how to deal with trouble , and believe me , that’s why i’m going to be elected president folks .
and we are leading in every poll , remember that please .
iran is a problem in iraq , a problem in syria , a problem in lebanon , a problem in yemen , and will be a very , very major problem for saudi arabia .
literally every day , iran provides more and better weapons to support their _UNK_ states .
_UNK_ , lebanon received , and i’ll tell you what , it has received sophisticated _UNK_ weapons , _UNK_ weapons , and gps systems and rockets .
like very few people anywhere in the world , and certainly very few countries have .
now they’re in syria trying to establish another front against israel from the syrian side of the _UNK_ heights .
in gaza , iran is supporting hamas and islamic _UNK_ .
and in the west bank they’re openly offering palestinians $ _UNK_ per terror attack and $ 30,000 for every palestinian _UNK_ home that’s been destroyed .
a _UNK_ , _UNK_ situation .
iran is financing military forces throughout the middle east , and it’s absolutely incredible that we handed them over $ 150 billion to do even more toward the many _UNK_ acts of terror .
_UNK_ , we will _UNK_ dismantle iran’s global terror network , which is big and powerful , but not powerful like us .
iran has _UNK_ terror groups all over the world .
during the last five years , iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents .
they’ve got terror cells everywhere , including in the western hemisphere very close to home .
iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach , believe me , believe me .
third , at the very least , we must enforce the terms of the previous deal , to hold iran _UNK_ accountable .
and we will enforce it like you’ve never seen a _UNK_ enforced before folks .
believe me .
iran has already since the deal is in place , _UNK_ ballistic missiles three times .
those ballistic missiles with a range of _UNK_ miles were designed to _UNK_ not only israel , which is only 600 miles away , but also intended to _UNK_ europe , and maybe someday hit even the united states .
and we’re not going to let that happen .
we’re not letting it happen , and we’re not letting it happen to israel , believe me .
do you want to hear something really _UNK_ ?
as many of the great people in this room know , _UNK_ on those missiles in both _UNK_ and _UNK_ , were the words `` israel must be wiped off the face of the earth . ''
you can forget that !
what kind of _UNK_ minds write that in _UNK_ ?
and here’s , you talk about twisted , here’s another twisted part : testing these missiles does not even violate the _UNK_ deal that we made !
the deal is silent on test missiles , but those tests do violate united nations security council resolutions .
the problem is , no one has done anything about it .
we will , we will , i promise we will .
which brings me to my next point .
the _UNK_ weakness and _UNK_ of the united nations .
the united nations is not a friend of democracy .
it’s not a friend to freedom .
it’s not a friend even to the united states of america , where as you know , it has its home .
and it surely is not a friend to israel .
with president obama in his final year , _UNK_ !
he may be the worst thing to ever happen to israel , believe me .
believe me , and you know it , and you know it better than anybody .
so with the president in his final year , discussions have been _UNK_ about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an _UNK_ agreement between israel and palestine .
let me be clear .
an agreement imposed by the united nations would be a total and complete disaster .
the united states must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto , which i will use as president , 100 percent .
when people ask why , it’s because that’s not how you make a deal .
deals are made when parties come together .
they come to a table and they negotiate .
each side must give up something it values , i mean we have to do something where there’s value in exchange for something that it requires .
that’s what a deal is .
a deal is really something that when we impose it on israel and palestine , we bring together a group of people that come up with something .
that’s not going to happen with the united nations .
it will only further , very importantly , it will only further _UNK_ israel .
it will be a catastrophe and a disaster for israel .
it’s not going to happen folks .
and further , it would reward palestinian terrorism , because every day they’re _UNK_ israelis , and even americans .
just last week , american _UNK_ allen force , a west point _UNK_ , _UNK_ young person who served in iraq and afghanistan , was murdered in the street by a _UNK_ palestinian .
you don’t reward behavior like that .
you can not do it !
there is only one way you treat that kind of behavior .
you have to confront it !
so , it’s not up the united nations to go with a solution .
it’s really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves .
you have no choice .
they have to do it themselves , or it will never hold up anyway .
the united states can be useful as a _UNK_ of negotiations , but no one should be telling israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don’t even really know what’s happening to israel , to anything in the area .
it’s so _UNK_ .
we’re not going to let that happen .
when i’m president , believe me , i will veto any attempt by the un to impose its will on the jewish state .
it will be _UNK_ 100 percent .
you see , i know about _UNK_ .
that’s what i do .
i wrote _UNK_ _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
one of the _UNK_ , _UNK_ , and i mean seriously , i’m saying _UNK_ _UNK_ , because i’ll be _UNK_ as though i say _UNK_ , so i’m going to be very diplomatic .
one of ... i’ll be _UNK_ .
i think it is number one , but why take a chance .
one of the _UNK_ , _UNK_ books about deals and deal making .
to make a great deal , you need two willing _UNK_ .
we know israel is willing to deal .
israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without _UNK_ for years .
you had camp david in _UNK_ , where prime minister _UNK_ made an incredible offer , maybe even too generous .
_UNK_ rejected it .
in 2008 , prime minister _UNK_ made an equally generous offer .
the palestinian authority rejected it also .
then john kerry tried to come up with a framework and abbas didn’t even respond , not even to the secretary of state of the united states of america .
they didn’t even respond .
when i become president , the days of treating israel like a _UNK_ citizen will end on day one .
and when i say something , i mean it .
i mean it .
i will meet with prime minister netanyahu immediately .
i have known him for many years and we’ll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to israel and to the entire region .
meanwhile , every single day , you have _UNK_ _UNK_ and children being taught to hate israel and hate the jews .
it has to stop .
when you live in a society where the firefighters are the _UNK_ , little kids want to be firefighters .
when you live in a society where _UNK_ and movie stars are the heroes , little kids want to be _UNK_ and movie stars .
in palestinian society , the heroes are those who murder jews .
we can’t let this continue .
we can’t let this happen any longer .
you can not achieve peace if terrorists are treated as _UNK_ .
_UNK_ terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace .
it is a _UNK_ , _UNK_ way to think .
it’s a barrier that can’t be broken .
that will end , and _UNK_ end soon , believe me .
in palestinian _UNK_ and mosques , you’ve got a culture of hatred that has been _UNK_ there for years , and if we want to achieve peace , they’ve got to go out , and they’ve got to start this educational process .
they have to end education of hatred .
they have to end it , and now !
there is no moral _UNK_ .
israel does not name public _UNK_ after terrorists .
israel does not pay its children to _UNK_ _UNK_ palestinians .
you see , what president obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies .
and you see that happening all the time .
that _UNK_ practiced by the president and his administration , including former secretary of state , hillary clinton , who is a total disaster by the way .
she and president obama have treated israel very , very badly .
but its repeated itself over and over again , and has done nothing to embolden those who hate america .
we saw that with releasing the $ 150 billion dollars to iran in the hope that they would _UNK_ join the world community .
it didn’t happen .
president obama thinks that applying pressure to israel will force the issue , but it’s precisely the opposite that happened .
already , half of the population of palestine has been taken over by the palestinian isis in hamas , and the other half refuses to confront the first half , so it’s a very difficult situation _UNK_ never going to get solved , unless you have great leadership right here in the united states .
we’ll get it solved , one way or the other .
we will get it solved .
but when the united states stands with israel , the chances of peace really rise , and rises _UNK_ .
that’s what will happen when donald trump is president of the united states .
we will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people , jerusalem .
and we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between america and our most reliable ally , the state of israel .
the palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the united states and israel is absolutely , _UNK_ unbreakable .
they must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against israel .
they must do that .
and they must come to the table willing to accept that israel is a jewish state and it will forever exist as a jewish state .
i love the people in this room .
i love israel .
i love israel .
i’ve been with israel so long in terms of , i’ve received some of my greatest honors from israel .
my father before me , incredible .
my daughter _UNK_ is about to have a beautiful jewish baby .
in fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as i’m concerned .
so i want to thank you very much .
this has been a truly great honor .
thank you everybody .
thank you .
thank you very much .
_UNK_ .
thank you very much .
hello .
i’d like to begin by thanking the people of _UNK_ , south dakota , new mexico , new jersey and california .
we had some big , big days and we have some big numbers coming in , very big numbers .
i’m truly honored by your support .
together , we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is and we’re only getting started and it’s going to be beautiful , remember that .
tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another .
our campaign received more primary votes than any _UNK_ campaign in history , no matter who it is , no matter who they are , we received more votes .
this is a great feeling .
that’s a great feeling .
this is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change , not obama change , but real change is possible .
you’ve given me the honor to lead the republican party to victory this fall .
we’re going to do it .
we’re going to do it , folks .
we’re going to do it .
i understand the responsibility of carrying the _UNK_ and i will never , ever let you down – too much work , too many people , blood , sweat and tears .
i’m never going to let you down .
i will make you proud of your party and our movement , and that’s what it is , is a movement .
now recent polls have shown that i’m _UNK_ hillary clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she’s made and she has tremendous mistakes , we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially .
to everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign , i want to thank you .
i want to thank you very , very much .
to those who voted for someone else in either party , i will work hard to earn your support and i will work very hard to earn that support .
to all of those _UNK_ _UNK_ voters who have been left out in the cold by a _UNK_ system of _UNK_ delegates , we welcome you with open arms .
and by the way , the terrible trade deals that _UNK_ was so _UNK_ against and he’s right on that will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible and that’s what i do .
we are going to have _UNK_ trade deals .
we’re going to start making money and bringing in jobs .
now i know some people say i’m too much of a fighter .
my preference is always peace , however and i’ve shown that .
i’ve shown that for a long time .
i built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved , always .
my goal is always again to bring people together .
but if i’m forced to fight for something i really care about , i will never , ever back down and our country will never , ever back down .
thank you .
i’ve fought for my family .
i’ve fought for my business .
i’ve fought for my employees .
and now , i’m going to fight for you , the american people like nobody has ever fought before .
and i’m not a politician fighting , i’m me .
you’re going to see some real good things happen .
just remember this : i’m going to be your champion .
i’m going to be america’s champion because you see this election isn’t about republican or democrat ; it’s about who runs this country – the special interests or the people and i mean the american people .
every election year politicians promise change .
obama promised change and it didn’t work out too well .
and every year they fail to deliver .
why would politicians want to change a system that’s _UNK_ _UNK_ in order to keep them in power ?
that’s what they’re doing , folks .
why would politicians want to change a system that’s made them and their friends very , very wealthy ?
i beat a _UNK_ system by winning with overwhelming support , the only way you _UNK_ done it – _UNK_ all over the country with every _UNK_ on track to win ; _UNK_ primary caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people .
after years of _UNK_ , there is one thing we all have learned – we can’t fix the _UNK_ system by relying on very , and i mean this so , so strongly , on the very people who _UNK_ it , and they _UNK_ it , and do not ever think anything differently .
we can’t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems .
the _UNK_ have turned the politics of personal _UNK_ into an _UNK_ form for themselves .
they’ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access , selling favors , selling government contracts , and i mean hundreds of millions of dollars .
secretary clinton even did all of the work on a _UNK_ illegal private _UNK_ .
something about how she’s getting away with this folks nobody understands .
designed to keep her corrupt _UNK_ out of the public record , putting the security of the entire country at risk and a president in a corrupt system is _UNK_ protecting her – not right .
i am going to give a major speech on probably monday of next week and we’re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the _UNK_ .
i think you’re going to find it very _UNK_ and very , very interesting .
i wonder if the press will want to attend , who knows .
hillary clinton turned the state department into her private hedge fund – the russians , the _UNK_ , the chinese – all gave money to bill and hillary and got _UNK_ treatment in return .
it’s a _UNK_ day in america when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens .
i didn’t need to do this .
it’s not easy , believe me .
i didn’t need to do it .
but i felt i had to give back to our wonderful country which has been so good to me and to my family .
i’ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people’s eyes .
i’ve visited communities in new york , new jersey , pennsylvania , connecticut , indiana and ohio whose manufacturing jobs , they literally , these jobs have virtually disappeared , an _UNK_ to our country and it’s _UNK_ .
i’ve embraced the victims of illegal immigration , moms and dads who have had to _UNK_ their own children because of people that shouldn’t have been in the country – remember it , folks , remember it .
i visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools .
i’ve seen our _UNK_ airports , highways , bridges and i’ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far _UNK_ to ours it’s really not to be believed , hard to imagine what’s happened to our country .
america is getting taken apart piece by piece , _UNK_ off , and just rapidly , _UNK_ off to the highest _UNK_ .
we’re broke , we’re broke .
we owe $ 19 trillion dollars going quickly to $ _UNK_ trillion .
our infrastructure is a disaster .
our schools are failing .
crime is rising .
people are scared .
the last thing we need is hillary clinton in the white house or an extension of the obama disaster .
what a crowd , what a crowd .
thank you all very much .
we love our country , we love our country .
but we can turn this all around .
we’re going to do it by putting america first .
that commitment is the foundation for change that’s been missing and it’s been missing for a long time .
it’s important to understand what america first means .
it means on foreign policy we will never enter into any kind conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation .
it has to make us safer as a nation .
this is the opposite of _UNK_ foreign policy which _UNK_ libya , _UNK_ iraq , unleashed isis and threw syria into chaos and created the mass _UNK_ which is _UNK_ _UNK_ all over the world , and while putting iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a _UNK_ power in the middle east and they are _UNK_ and we have made them that way , folks .
we have made them that way .
you better hope i’m president .
on trade , america first means the american worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition .
what’s happening there is absolutely a _UNK_ .
no _UNK_ , you’re right about that and you mean no _UNK_ .
we are going , and remember this ; we are only going to have great trade deals , _UNK_ we are only going to have that .
we’re not going to _UNK_ , as somebody just said , the _UNK_ partnership which is a disaster , a disaster , for our country , almost as bad as _UNK_ signed by bill clinton , which has just _UNK_ our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places , in particular mexico .
if it’s not a great deal for our country , we will not sign it .
it’s got to be great for our country , for our community , for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we’re suffering _UNK_ and it’s getting worse .
on energy policy , america first means opening up america’s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers including our wonderful and _UNK_ miners who have been absolutely _UNK_ _UNK_ by this administration .
on economic policy , america first means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the united states , substantially lowering taxes for middle class americans and business ; likewise , regulation which is _UNK_ our economy which would be brought down from its present _UNK_ level .
we will make it very , very good for our companies , for our small business and for people that want to survive and do well in our country .
on immigration policy , america first means protecting the jobs , wages and security of american workers , whether first or _UNK_ generation .
no matter who you are , we’re going to protect your job because let me tell you our jobs are being _UNK_ from our country like we’re _UNK_ .
the beauty of america first is that it brings us all together .
every american worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits , protections and rights and _UNK_ ; it’s got to be that way .
now , the people in charge say things can’t change .
i’m here today to tell you that we have to change .
we have no choice .
we have to change .
we’re going to put america back to work .
we’re going to make our own products .
we’re going to put america back to work .
we’re going to rebuild our inner cities which are absolutely a shame and so _UNK_ .
we’re going to take care of our african american people that have been _UNK_ for so long .
we’re going to make you and your family safe , secure and prosperous , prosperous again .
together , we will put the american people first again , first again .
we will make our communities wealthy .
we will make our cities safe again .
we will make our country strong again .
ladies and gentlemen , we will make america great again , remember .
thank you .
thank you very much everybody .
thank you for joining me today .
this was going to be a speech on hillary clinton and how bad a president , especially in these times of radical islamic terrorism , she would be .
even her former secret service agent , who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress , has stated that she _UNK_ the _UNK_ and integrity to be president .
there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time , and i will deliver that speech soon .
but today there is only one thing to discuss : the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders .
the attack on the _UNK_ _UNK_ in _UNK_ , florida , was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since september 11th , and the worst mass shooting in our country’s history .
so many people dead , so many people gravely injured , so much carnage , such a _UNK_ .
the horror is beyond _UNK_ .
the families of these wonderful people are _UNK_ devastated .
likewise , our whole nation , and indeed the whole world , is devastated .
we express our deepest _UNK_ to the victims , the wounded , and their families .
we mourn , as one people , for our nation’s loss – and pledge our support to any and all who need it .
i would like to ask now that we all _UNK_ a moment of silence for the victims of the attack .
[ silence ] our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of _UNK_ 's _UNK_ community .
this is a very dark moment in america’s history .
a radical islamic terrorist targeted the _UNK_ not only because he wanted to kill americans , but in order to execute gay and _UNK_ citizens because of their sexual orientation .
it is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation .
it is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives , love who they want and express their identity .
it is an attack on the right of every single american to live in peace and safety in their own country .
we need to respond to this attack on america as one united people – with force , purpose and determination .
but the current politically correct response _UNK_ our ability to talk and think and act clearly .
if we do n't get tough , and we do n't get smart – and fast – we 're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left .
the _UNK_ , whose name i will not use , or ever say , was born to afghan parents who _UNK_ to the united states .
his father published support for the afghan taliban , a regime which _UNK_ those who don’t share its radical views .
the father even said he was running for president of that country .
the bottom line is that the only reason the _UNK_ was in america in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here .
that is a fact , and it 's a fact we need to talk about .
we have a _UNK_ immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country , and it does not permit us to protect our citizens .
we have an _UNK_ administration , and if i am not elected president , that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change , and it must change now .
with fifty people dead , and dozens more wounded , we can not afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on .
i called for a ban after san _UNK_ , and was met with great _UNK_ and anger but now , many are saying i was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary , we must find out what is going on .
the ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly _UNK_ those people coming into our country .
the immigration laws of the united states give the president the power to _UNK_ _UNK_ into the country of any class of persons that the president _UNK_ _UNK_ to the interests or security of the united states , as he _UNK_ appropriate .
i will use this power to protect the american people .
when i am elected , i will _UNK_ immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the united states , europe or our allies , until we understand how to end these threats .
after a full , impartial and long _UNK_ security assessment , we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of america .
we can not continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to _UNK_ into our country , many of whom have the same thought process as this savage _UNK_ .
many of the principles of radical islam are incompatible with western values and institutions .
radical islam is _UNK_ , _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
i refuse to allow america to become a place where gay people , christian people , and jewish people , are the targets of persecution and intimidation by radical islamic _UNK_ of hate and violence .
it’s not just a national security issue .
it is a quality of life issue .
if we want to protect the quality of life for all americans – women and children , gay and straight , jews and christians and all people – then we need to tell the truth about radical islam .
we need to tell the truth , also , about how radical islam is coming to our shores .
we are _UNK_ radical islamic terrorism into the west through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president .
even our own fbi director has _UNK_ that we can not effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into america .
all of the september 11th _UNK_ were issued visas .
large numbers of _UNK_ refugees in minnesota have tried to join isis .
the boston _UNK_ came here through political _UNK_ .
the _UNK_ _UNK_ in san _UNK_ – again , whose name i wo n't mention -- was the child of immigrants from pakistan , and he brought his wife – the other terrorist - from saudi arabia , through another one of our easily exploited visa programs .
immigration from afghanistan into the united states has increased nearly _UNK_ in just one year .
according to _UNK_ research , 99 % of people in afghanistan support _UNK_ _UNK_ law .
we admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same _UNK_ views .
if we want to remain a free and open society , then we have to control our borders .
yet , hillary clinton – for months and despite so many attacks – repeatedly refused to even say the words `` radical islam , '' until i challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race .
however , hillary clinton – who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage – still has no _UNK_ what radical islam is , and won’t speak honestly about what it is .
she is in total denial , and her continuing _UNK_ to ever name the enemy _UNK_ weakness across the world .
in fact , just a few weeks before the san _UNK_ slaughter , hillary clinton explained her _UNK_ to say the words radical islam .
here is what she said : `` muslims are peaceful and tolerant people , and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism . ''
hillary clinton says the solution is to ban guns .
they tried that in france , which has among the toughest gun laws in the world , and _UNK_ were _UNK_ murdered by islamic terrorists in cold blood .
her plan is to _UNK_ law-abiding americans , _UNK_ the 2nd amendment , and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns .
she wants to take away americans’ guns , then admit the very people who want to slaughter us .
i will be meeting with the nra , which has given me their earliest _UNK_ in a presidential race , to discuss how to ensure americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror .
the bottom line is that hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of radical islam into america , and allow it to grow overseas .
in fact , hillary _UNK_ catastrophic immigration plan will bring _UNK_ more radical islamic immigration into this country , threatening not only our security but our way of life .
when it comes to radical islamic terrorism , ignorance is not _UNK_ – it 's deadly .
the obama administration , with the support of hillary clinton and others , has also damaged our security by _UNK_ our _UNK_ and failing to support law enforcement .
they have put political _UNK_ above common sense , above your safety , and above all else .
i refuse to be politically correct .
i will do the right thing -- i want to _UNK_ things out and to make america great again .
the days of deadly ignorance will end , and they will end soon .
as president i will give our intelligence community , law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks .
we need an _UNK_ system second to none .
that includes better cooperation between state , local and federal officials – and with our allies .
i will have an attorney general , a director of national intelligence , and a secretary of defense who will know how to fight the war on radical islamic terrorism – and who will have the support they require to get the job done .
we also must ensure the american people are provided the information they need to understand the threat .
the senate _UNK_ on immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the united states since september 11th .
nearly a year ago , the senate _UNK_ asked president obama 's _UNK_ of justice , state and homeland security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the united states .
these _UNK_ refused to comply .
president obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals _UNK_ in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11 .
the public has a right to know how these people got here .
we have to _UNK_ _UNK_ to know whether they are _UNK_ with , or support , radical groups and beliefs .
we have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of _UNK_ from _UNK_ inside america .
even a single individual can be devastating , just look at what happened in _UNK_ .
can you imagine large groups ?
truly , our president does n't know what he is doing .
he has failed us , and failed us badly , and under his leadership , this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse .
each year , the united states permanently _UNK_ more than 100,000 immigrants from the middle east , and many more from muslim countries outside the middle east .
our government has been _UNK_ _UNK_ numbers , year after year , without any effective plan for our security .
in fact , clinton 's state department was in charge of the _UNK_ process for people applying to enter from overseas .
having learned nothing from these attacks , she now plans to _UNK_ increase _UNK_ without a screening plan , including a 500 % increase in syrian refugees .
this could be a better , bigger version of the _UNK_ _UNK_ horse .
we ca n't let this happen .
altogether , under the clinton plan , you 'd be _UNK_ hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east with no system to _UNK_ them , or to prevent the _UNK_ of their children .
the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to _UNK_ who we are bringing in .
the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and _UNK_ americans .
the burden is also on hillary clinton to tell us how she will pay for it .
her plan will cost americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term .
would n't this money be better spent on rebuilding america for our current population , including the many poor people already living here ?
we have to stop the tremendous flow of syrian refugees into the united states – we do n't know who they are , they have no _UNK_ , and we do n't know what they 're planning .
what i want is common sense .
i want a _UNK_ immigration policy that promotes american values .
that is the choice i put before the american people : a _UNK_ immigration policy designed to benefit america , or hillary clinton 's radical immigration policy designed to benefit _UNK_ special interests .
we 've got to get smart , and tough , and vigilant , and we 've got to do it now , because later is too late .
the media talks about `` homegrown , '' terrorism , but islamic _UNK_ , and the networks that _UNK_ it , are imports from overseas .
yes , there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past .
but the whole point is that it will be much , much easier to deal with our current problem if we don’t keep on bringing in people who add to the problem .
for instance , the controversial mosque _UNK_ by the boston _UNK_ had as its _UNK_ an immigrant from overseas charged in an _UNK_ plot .
this _UNK_ in _UNK_ was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth .
why would we admit people who support violent hatred ?
hillary clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring islamic extremists to our country who suppress women , gays and anyone who doesn’t share their views .
she can’t have it both ways .
she can’t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to _UNK_ them .
how does this kind of immigration make our life better ?
how does this kind of immigration make our country better ?
why does hillary clinton want to bring people _UNK_ vast _UNK_ reject our values ?
ask yourself , who is really the friend of women and the _UNK_ community , donald trump with his actions , or hillary clinton with her words ?
clinton wants to allow radical islamic terrorists to _UNK_ into our _UNK_ _UNK_ women , and murder gays .
i don’t want them in our country .
immigration is a privilege , and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn’t support our communities – all of our communities .
america has already _UNK_ four times more immigrants than any country on earth , and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny .
not _UNK_ , wages for our workers haven’t _UNK_ in many years .
so whether it’s matter of national security , or financial security , we can’t afford to keep on going like this .
we owe $ 19 trillion in debt , and no longer have options .
all our communities , from all backgrounds , are ready for some relief .
this is not an act of offense against anyone ; it is an act of defense .
i want us all to work together , including in partnership with our muslim communities .
but muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad – and they do know where they are .
i want to fix our schools , roads , bridges and job market .
i want every american to succeed .
hillary clinton wants to empty out the treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who _UNK_ hate against our own citizens .
i want to protect our citizens – all of our citizens .
the terrorist attack on the _UNK_ night _UNK_ demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault .
in san _UNK_ , as an example , people knew what was going on , but they used the excuse of racial _UNK_ for not reporting it .
we need to know what the _UNK_ discussed with his _UNK_ , parents , friends and _UNK_ .
we need to know if he was _UNK_ with any radical mosques or radical activists and what , if any , is their immigration status .
we need to know if he _UNK_ anywhere , and who he _UNK_ with .
we need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan – including anyone who knew something but did n't tell us – is brought to justice .
if it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack , and did not give this information to authorities , they must serve prison time .
america must do more – much more – to protect its citizens , especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual _UNK_ .
it also means we must change our foreign policy .
the decision to overthrow the regime in libya , then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in syria , among other things , without plans for the day after , have created space for isis to expand and grow .
these actions , along with our disastrous iran deal , have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our muslim allies in the region .
that is why our new goal must be to defeat islamic terrorism , not _UNK_ .
for instance , the last major nato mission was hillary clinton 's war in libya .
that mission helped unleash isis on a new continent .
i 've said nato needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism .
since i 've raised that criticism , nato has since announced a new initiative focused on just that .
america must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against islamic terrorism , just like we did against communism in the cold war .
we 've tried it president obama 's way .
he gave the world his _UNK_ tour , we got isis , and many other problems , in return .
i 'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of _UNK_ who have come under attack .
when i am president , i pledge to protect and defend all americans who live inside of our borders .
wherever they come from , wherever they were born , all americans living here and following our laws will be protected .
america will be a tolerant and open society .
america will also be a safe society .
we will protect our borders at home .
we will defeat isis overseas .
we will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety .
we will make america rich again .
we will make america safe again .
we will make american great again .
thank you .
... we’re doing really well .
_UNK_ been amazing .
it’s been amazing .
we’re doing so well and i love this place and i’m back here all the time and i’m going to be here a lot in january .
you’re going to be so sick of me .
you’ll probably say , `` we can’t give – the caucus , just forget it .
we can’t stand the guy any more . ''
no , you’re going to like me and we’re going to be back and we’re going to do a great job for you .
most importantly , we’re going to get to that office and we’re going to do the right thing .
we’re going to do the right thing .
so , a few things .
a lot – so much has happened .
you know , when we first came out , we were all talking together .
and we were talking border security , which we’re just doing so great with the border security .
we’re going to build a wall .
mexico’s going to pay for the wall .
we all know that .
but we’re going to have security .
and the drugs are going to stop and the people that are going to come into the country but they’re going to come into the country they’re going to be legal , they’re coming in legally , and that’s the way .
that’s the way .
and it affects iowa so much .
so we were talking about .
so we were talking about that .
we were talking about _UNK_ obamacare .
boom .
it’s going to be _UNK_ .
it’s going to be replaced .
i don’t know if you’ve been seeing what’s happening but obamacare is a total disaster .
it’s dying of its own weight .
and by _UNK_ , meaning he’ll be playing _UNK_ and i’ll be working very hard .
but _UNK_ instead you’re not getting the people signed up .
there’s been a lot of talk about it and a lot of stories about it .
_UNK_ dead but we’ll _UNK_ it _UNK_ than that .
and we will come up with something that will be so good , so much better .
premiums are going through the roof .
_UNK_ are so high that unless you’re close to death , you’ll never going to get to use .
and even then i don’t think you’re going to get to use it really .
so , we’re going to take care of that .
and by the way , we have a lot of good people .
we have _UNK_ .
nobody is really – we have the _UNK_ – where are the _UNK_ people ?
right ?
i was here a month ago and i met with them all and they do a _UNK_ job .
i _UNK_ the plants and they do a _UNK_ job but it’s so important .
and it’s another form of let’s stay away from _UNK_ and let’s stay away from that middle east stuff .
it’s so important ... actually what i don’t understand because the one guy that’s doing pretty good with me in iowa is ted cruz and he’s a nice guy .
i mean , everything i say he agrees with me .
no matter what i say .
i was going to do one really wild but he agrees .
but with the _UNK_ , really , he’s got to come a long way because he’s right now for the oil .
but i understand it .
oil pays him a lot of money .
he’s got to be for oil , right ?
the oil companies give him a lot of money .
but i’m with you .
i’m with everybody .
look , i’m _UNK_ funding .
i have no oil company .
i have no special interest .
i have no _UNK_ that want me and you know , they’re _UNK_ countries that are _UNK_ off the country , they’re _UNK_ companies that are _UNK_ off our country .
all i do is i’m going to be working for you folks .
we’re going to do this thing together .
we’re going to make america so great again and maybe better than ever before .
so important .
so when we first started , i talked about china how they’re _UNK_ us and japan and mexico .
mexico both at the border and in trade .
they’re taking so many of our companies .
_UNK_ moving there with their big plant .
ford is moving there with a big plant .
they took a big plant away from tennessee – a great state – they took it away at the last moment .
i’m not going to let that stuff .
we’re going to do what we have to do , okay ?
but i talked about that ... and i talk about it a lot .
the fact is that about 2.5 weeks ago with paris , i’m speaking a little bit differently now .
believe me , i can take care of china in my back pocket .
that’s easy for me .
that’s what i do .
and we have all the cards .
a lot of people don’t know .
you know , these politicians they don’t understand we have the cards .
you know , with china , our people pay tax .
they pay no tax .
it’s not supposed to be that way .
they call it a _UNK_ because it sounds better .
but we’ll take care of that .
we’ll take care of all of that .
what happened is with paris , there’s a different _UNK_ .
and when the polls came out last week , my numbers went way up because people felt more secure with me .
now , maybe it had to do – who knows why ?
who knows ?
but my poll numbers went up .
and do you ever notice whenever there’s something that i do that’s proper but controversial , they’d say `` oh , now he’s gone .
that’s it .
that’s the end . ''
i won’t go over all of the different things because maybe you’ll change your minds .
but they’d say , `` that’s it .
it’s over . ''
and then they’d come in , `` sir , your poll number went up 9 points this week . ''
i said , `` they did ? ''
because i have to do what’s right .
i have to do what’s right .
and you know what ?
if i don’t make it , i don’t make it .
i have a good life .
we all hopefully have a good life .
i have a great family , nice people , wonderful people .
they love me .
i think .
i hope .
i think .
but i have a great family and i built a great business .
... there’s such spirit ... there’s such spirit no matter where i go .
you know , i go to dallas .
we have 20,000 .
_UNK_ people in mobile , alabama .
20,000 people in oklahoma .
wherever we go in iowa , we have these crowds .
you know this is supposed to be ... for like a record .
it is big and yet it feels _UNK_ .
it feels good ... ... so i changed a couple of weeks ago .
when i saw paris i changed .
and a big , big part of what i’m doing now is safety and security and _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
sort of interesting .
you know , the _UNK_ is `` make america great again '' and i’m adding `` make america great again and safe again '' because we don’t feel safe anymore .
and the problem we have now that we’ve never had to this extent is the power of _UNK_ .
it’s the power .
it’s the tremendous power .
you know , 100 years ago , i would have said `` let’s not go . ''
i said `` don’t go there '' anyway .
and i said it strongly `` don’t go .
you’re going to _UNK_ the middle east . ''
but the fact is right now , we’re going to have to do things because we have some really , really sick _UNK_ .
and the press – look at all those cameras going all live , all – you know , nobody else has cameras like this .
they can make a speech 100 times they make a speech , nobody cares .
look at this .
and don’t worry , they never _UNK_ the crowd .
you know , they never ; they have me .
that’s why i’m walking around .
i figured i’ll walk around maybe they’ll get the crowd .
they never _UNK_ the crowd .
i tell them `` _UNK_ the crowd '' , they never do .
... i had a crowd _UNK_ people last week .
more .
_UNK_ people and in a _UNK_ space .
they had 3,000 people outside that couldn’t get in .
my wife says , `` _UNK_ , the speech was excellent .
did you have many people there ? ''
i said `` what ? ''
she said , `` well , they never leave your face . ''
they keep it _UNK_ .
but i’ll tell you the cameras may be a little _UNK_ up where you can’t move them , right ?
but every time there’s a _UNK_ `` well , i’m _UNK_ '' and it can be in the back _UNK_ corner of the room , the cameras _UNK_ over there .
it’s true .
it’s true .
it’s true .
no , i used to think they couldn’t move .
you know , maybe there’s something with the _UNK_ computers .
you know , in the old days everything was better right ?
the car seats .
you’d sit in your car and you want to move forward and back , you press a button .
_UNK_ , _UNK_ .
now , you have to open up things , press a computer , takes you 15 minutes .
well , the same thing i figured with cameras .
i didn’t think they moved .
i figured they were fixed for certain reasons .
and then i saw a _UNK_ and those cameras were bent in positions like you wouldn’t believe possible .
so , they’re very _UNK_ people .
what can i say ?
not all of them but most of them .
i’ll tell you , you have one of the most _UNK_ right here in your _UNK_ .
the _UNK_ _UNK_ register is the worst .
they are the worst .
the worst .
no , they’re very _UNK_ .
you have some reporter named _UNK_ .
she is the worst .
she will write – so – it’s such _UNK_ .
and so i don’t care .
i mean , who cares ?
so i’m saying it right in their _UNK_ .
they’re failing anyway .
they probably won’t be in business in two years .
i think they’re losing a fortune .
i think .
you know , it’s funny .
every time the _UNK_ _UNK_ register does a poll , i always do badly .
... i’m only doing this so they don’t _UNK_ me but i don’t mind if they do .
i hope they _UNK_ me because they don’t have enough money to _UNK_ me .
that’s the good thing .
but i believe and i may be wrong – in fact , i’ll say i’m sure i’m wrong but it’s my opinion that they don’t do it properly because you know they poll like 300 or 400 people .
i’ll explain it ... you know , if they lose 20 people in the pocket .
`` oh , trump ?
oh , forget that one .
forget that one . ''
now , i don’t know that they do that .
do you do that , _UNK_ _UNK_ register ?
but every time i have a _UNK_ _UNK_ register poll , i do poorly .
i also do poorly with the bloomberg polls .
i don’t know why .
but we had a great poll come in – cnn last couple of days – where we’re leading i think by 13 points in iowa .
in iowa .
and then we have another coming where we’re doing well .
but i think _UNK_ _UNK_ register has somebody says it’s coming out sometime .
i’ll just tell you , watch – `` trump _UNK_ ! ''
i think we’re going to do so well .
i think we’re actually going to even do better .
you know , we’re leading in most of the poll .
we’re leading in every poll .
except iowa there was one poll – there was one poll , _UNK_ – i’d never even heard _UNK_ .
what the hell is _UNK_ ?
what is _UNK_ ?
explain it .
i don’t like _UNK_ .
you know why i don’t like it ?
because they always treat me badly also .
but i only like polls that treat me well .
but we’re doing so well .
nationwide , we’re leading every poll by tremendous .
we just had one in georgia – _UNK_ % .
_UNK_ % .
think of that .
that’s _UNK_ % with 15 people .
i’d take _UNK_ % if we had three people .
i don’t think i’d take it if we had two people but i think i’d take if we had three .
but _UNK_ % .
_UNK_ came out as you know , you probably saw that , new york times two days ago and we’re at 35 % to a small number .
we’re killing everybody in every poll .
just one little _UNK_ here .
... again , i’m sure when _UNK_ _UNK_ comes out _UNK_ be a negative because i don’t believe that poll .
but we are going to win .
and i’ll tell you what .
honestly , iowa is so important to me .
i could say , `` oh , let’s not do '' – i am an _UNK_ .
i am a christian .
i’m a _UNK_ .
i’m a _UNK_ .
i love billy _UNK_ .
franklin _UNK_ came out with the most beautiful statements .
franklin _UNK_ .
he was so incredible .
he came out – i don’t know if you all saw the statements he came out with about trump ... he was so incredible .
franklin _UNK_ was amazing , the son of billy _UNK_ , who was , you know , there’s nobody , nobody that i’ve ever seen – billy _UNK_ was _UNK_ .
if _UNK_ gone to his _UNK_ , they were incredible .
but so i think we’re going to do – we’re doing really well with the _UNK_ ... and by the way and again , i do like ted cruz but not a lot of _UNK_ come out of cuba in all fairness .
it’s true .
not a lot come out .
but i like him nevertheless .
i think we’re going to do great and we are doing great with _UNK_ .
we’re doing great with the tea party , leading with the tea party .
and we’re doing _UNK_ with all the young and middle .
we’re doing great with everybody .
and so it’s very important for me to win iowa .
now , i could put less pressure on myself and i could say , `` oh , i don’t care about iowa .
i don’t care . ''
but i do care .
i do care so much about it .
that’s why we’re here all the time .
and then the lies happened .
you know , when i was using iowa , they _UNK_ so much .
i said , `` the people of iowa can’t be that _UNK_ or the people of the country can’t – `` .
i’m trying to make a point , right ?
so i said , `` the people of the country can’t be that _UNK_ . ''
well , they cut the `` country '' out so it’s _UNK_ to iowa .
i love you people .
remember that .
remember that .
i was talking about something , and i won’t even mention what i’m talking about because the guy i’m talking about and was actually a very good guy .
but i will say this .
we want to win iowa so bad .
because if i win iowa , i think we’d run the table .
i really do .
i think we’d run the table .
we’d go right through .
because we’re leading big in new hampshire – every poll .
big .
big in new hampshire .
_UNK_ got an _UNK_ from this _UNK_ newspaper up there .
it’s the _UNK_ deal i’ve ever seen .
and you know the paper that was in his state called up and said , `` are you sure about that ?
nobody ever called us . ''
they can’t believe it .
and we can get into that but it’s _UNK_ .
but we’re leading new hampshire big .
we’re leading in south carolina like _UNK_ numbers .
we’re leading ... nevada .
we’re leading in texas .
we’re leading everywhere .
we’re leading big in florida .
now , you have _UNK_ – nice guy , by the way .
you have _UNK_ and he is a nice guy but you’ve got to vote .
when people put you in a position to be a senator , you’ve got to go and vote .
you can’t be the number one person that doesn’t vote in the senate .
you’ve got to say , `` hey , i’m a young guy .
i want to go and vote . ''
you should stay there a little longer .
he’s a good guy .
stay there , go in , vote , create a nice record .
but i don’t know .
_UNK_ he doing in iowa ?
not too good .
right ?
he’s not doing well .
_UNK_ _UNK_ doing ?
not good .
i mean , it seems like a _UNK_ race right now ... and it’s an important race to me .
so i just want to let you know it’s very important .
so with all of that , if we win iowa , a lot of people say we’d just go through .
i think we’ll win virtually every state in the union and it’s over quickly .
over quickly .
... what about the republican _UNK_ ?
the _UNK_ got a problem , you know .
it’s sort of like the fighters .
you know , the great _UNK_ .
sometimes they’ll go into the hometown of a guy they’re fighting and they’ll say , `` you know , we’d never want to get a decision .
we go for the _UNK_ .
the _UNK_ is the _UNK_ . ''
because you get a lot of bad decisions .
i know a lot about the world of sports , believe me , and they go into a hometown to fight and it’s a decision and they say , `` _UNK_ , we’re in a problem '' and they’d lose the fight that they won .
the only way they win the fight definitely – knock out .
so , if we win iowa , i think we’re going to win everything after that .
so i think it’s going to show how important iowa is .
... i’ll pledge this to iowa .
even if i lose , i’ll pledge it , okay ?
i don’t think i’ve ever said that in my life .
if we go and win , _UNK_ staying right where it is in the chain .
it’s not moving .
you know , there’s a big move to move iowa into a much further back position by the _UNK_ .
folks , i win it’s not happening , okay ?
you’re staying right here because it’s great .
it’s great .
... you’ve been paying into social security and medicare , by the way .
let’s put them in .
because medicare does work .
with both , you have tremendous waste , fraud , and abuse .
we’re going to take care of that .
okay ?
but we’re not going to cut your social security and we’re not cutting your medicare .
we’re going to take jobs back from all these countries that are _UNK_ us off .
we’re going to become a wealthy country again .
and we’re going to be able to save your social security .
... i can’t believe this number but i read it over – who is the man that told me the number – over 6 million people – i can’t believe it – are _UNK_ _UNK_ and over are getting social security ... but i heard it .
i read it .
a tremendous – like 6 million people are getting social security .
they’re dead .
meaning somebody else is _UNK_ up ... ... the press is going to have to check it because what do i know ?
but can you imagine , we have 6 million – now , we know there’s not 6 million , there may be one .
but there’s not 6 million .
anybody in this room _UNK_ or over ?
because if they are , i want to shake your hand .
but – so 6 million over _UNK_ years old _UNK_ up social security and that’s the beginning .
so there’s tremendous waste , fraud , and abuse .
what we’re going to do is we’re going to save medicare .
we’re going to save social security .
we’re not going to raise the age or we’re not going to do all the things that everyone else is talking about doing .
they’re all talking about doing it , and you don’t have to .
we’re going to bring our jobs back .
we’re going to make our economy incredible again .
my tax proposal , which is in , and a great detail in terms of policy and it’s gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people , a lot of great groups .
but we are going to cut taxes _UNK_ for the middle class and for businesses because our middle class is being _UNK_ .
and when that happens , you’re going to see an economy that takes off .
we’re going to get rid of a lot of that debt , if not all of it .
but we’re going to get rid of it – you know , we’re at $ 19 trillion going _UNK_ $ _UNK_ trillion right .
you know , if you go back eight or nine years , trillion wasn’t even a word anybody knew and now it’s like routine .
so we are going to save your social security without cuts .
we’re going to bring the economy back .
we’re going to make ourselves rich again .
a woman said to me in new hampshire recently , she said , `` mr. trump , i’m voting for you .
i love you .
but it’s very crude when you say you’re going to make our country rich again . ''
i said , `` i know it’s crude .
it sounds bad .
but many things i say are crude .
it sounds bad .
but we can’t make our country great again unless we make our country rich again .
we can’t let everybody in the world _UNK_ us off .
... we just did a big _UNK_ with cnn just before this .
and you know , hillary – was hillary missing today ?
what happened ?
she was two hours late .
no , did you hear ?
now , i may be wrong .
if i’m one minute off , they’ll call me because they love hillary .
they love her .
you know why .
i don’t know why .
why ?
i’m trying to figure it .
no , i heard she was a couple of hours late .
everybody left .
you know what happened ?
she was _UNK_ .
i’m telling you .
she couldn’t get out of bed .
she was _UNK_ .
she was _UNK_ .
was right .
... remember , we built china .
the money they took out of country , we rebuilt china .
you go there , they have bridges all over the – they have bridges like the george washington bridge .
maybe i shouldn’t mention that particular bridge .
but like bigger like the george washington bridge .
only a few people got that one ; that’s okay .
but they have bridges going up .
we have rebuilt china .
they’ve taken our jobs .
they’ve taken our base .
they’ve taken our manufacturing all over the place .
they’ve taken our money .
they’ve taken our money .
not going to happen anymore folks .
not going to happen anymore .
not going to happen .
i know the great business people .
we have the greatest business people in the world .
guys like carl _UNK_ .
he calls me , `` donald , i want to help .
i want to help . ''
the _UNK_ people call .
we’re not going to use the special interest guy – a _UNK_ .
we use _UNK_ to negotiate with china because he gave some guy like , you know , whoever it might be .
because again , i’m the only one that’s _UNK_ my campaign .
everybody else isn’t .
these guys – when these guys give money to politicians to a large extent they own those politicians .
they will do whatever the hell the special interests and the _UNK_ want .
that’s not going to happen with me .
so , social security – we’re saving it .
medicare – we’re saving it .
we’re going to make our country rich .
okay ?
thank you , _UNK_ .
... yeah , it’s called the _UNK_ of limitations , right ?
and you know it’s a _UNK_ year _UNK_ .
maybe five but it’s probably six .
but it’s a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
yeah , you have to look at it .
look , hillary clinton – you know this story .
it’s a crime .
she committed a crime .
now , perhaps – perhaps – somebody , you know , we have to have a fair justice department and perhaps ... we’ll have some really good attorney general that’s going to say `` well , you know '' .
look , we want to be fair to everybody .
okay ?
including hillary clinton .
but she committed a crime in my opinion .
now , she shouldn’t be allowed to run .
she’s being protected absolutely .
i have little doubt that they’re going to find anything .
but they’ve already found it .
i mean , you watch television .
you have all these big scholars , these lawyers , `` yes , she violated section so and so '' .
just one after another .
i mean , actually violated many , many laws , not just like a little one here .
many laws .
you mentioned general petraeus .
his life was destroyed over 5 % of what hillary clinton did .
over nothing .
so i think she’s going to be their nominee definitely .
the only question is whether or not _UNK_ be allowed to run .
she’s being protected by the democrats .
she’s being protected by the president .
and that’s why – why do you think she’s going along with these _UNK_ policies of his ?
okay ?
i mean , she goes along with everything .
i don’t even – honestly in all fairness to her , i don’t think she believes it .
but i think she’s afraid he’s going to say , `` listen , i don’t like her anymore .
go take care of her .
i’m going to get somebody else . ''
i’m telling you .
so , the question is _UNK_ of limitations .
it’s a five year _UNK_ of limitations .
she’s got a problem .
she’s got a problem .
in one way , she’s running for her life because i know one thing , if she _UNK_ that’s the end of that .
right ?
but if she _UNK_ she could have a very serious problem .
... ... well , i said right at the beginning .
we’re going to build a wall that’s going to be a real wall .
that’s going to be a real wall .
it’s not going to be – you see that ceiling ?
that ceiling is nothing compared to the wall .
and we can build it and we can build it right .
and it will be strong and powerful and as beautiful as a wall is going to look .
it’s got to be beautiful because someday they’re going to name it the trump wall .
i know that .
it’s going to happen .
going to happen .
and it’s going to work .
and walls do work .
you know , they wanted to build a wall here 20 years ago .
you know they couldn’t get environmental impact statements .
that’s just shows you .
china is building in the south china sea massive military bases .
right ?
why ?
they’re not supposed to .
they have no respect for obama or our country .
they’re not supposed to be doing that .
and you could get them to stop just by saying `` we’re not doing business with you anymore . ''
their whole economy would – you don’t have to go to war .
it’s economics .
the whole country would collapse in two _UNK_ .
believe me .
we have such power and we don’t know it .
but they’re building massive – now , they had little islands .
they put the biggest _UNK_ , not _UNK_ .
i think they’re using _UNK_ from japan ... they have these massive _UNK_ , and i said to a friend of mine who’s chinese from china – very rich guy , very successful guy , paid me a fortune for an apartment so i happen to like him , okay ?
– i said _UNK_ `` how long did it take them to do these massive islands they’re building right out of the sea ?
boom , those _UNK_ go in , take out everything .
how long did it take you to get the environmental impact statements ? ''
he _UNK_ .
he said , `` what are you _UNK_ me ?
nothing . ''
they say `` we will build there . ''
about two _UNK_ later , you have _UNK_ _UNK_ .
so we had a problem with environmental – look , i’ve won many environmental _UNK_ .
i’m a big _UNK_ especially in clean air and clean water .
i’m a big _UNK_ .
just so you know .
big .
and i’ve gotten so many _UNK_ for the environment .
so i understand the environment ; i’ve won many , many _UNK_ .
but when you look at how we’re _UNK_ and hurt .
but the wall was stopped because they couldn’t get an environmental impact statement among other things .
they couldn’t get an environmental impact statement .
now , there was probably a _UNK_ or a _UNK_ or a _UNK_ or something .
you were _UNK_ the _UNK_ of a _UNK_ .
i don’t know .
but they actually had people – a lot of people – people that now would be against it but they wanted to build a wall and years ago they couldn’t get it done .
... you know , i said bomb the oil , right ?
i’ve been saying that for three years .
now finally they started – after paris they started bombing the oil .
i’ve been saying it for years .
you know one of the reasons we didn’t bomb the oil ?
obama didn’t want to hurt the environment .
now , i heard that and i thought somebody was _UNK_ .
i thought a _UNK_ was saying it .
it turned out to be true .
he didn’t want the flames and everything going into the atmosphere .
this is the way we fight today .
i’m telling you , folks , we’re being led by _UNK_ people .
we’re being led by _UNK_ people .
i’ve been saying not really bomb – i’ve been saying take the oil .
i didn’t want to go into iraq .
but once we were there , i said `` look , we shouldn’t have been there .
but then when we left , we left the wrong way . ''
first of all , we have a president who told them a date .
`` we’re going to leave on such and such a date . ''
what was it like 18 months later ?
so the enemy all of sudden said , `` _UNK_ '' , _UNK_ don’t believe it .
they don’t want to be killed .
okay ?
they don’t want to be killed .
so the enemy said `` they’re going to leave on a certain date ? ''
so they pulled back , the date comes , and now you see what happened .
it’s a disaster and iran is taking over iraq .
so anyway , i couldn’t believe it when they said that .
when we said to our 50 soldiers two weeks ago and our president gets up and _UNK_ `` we are sending 50 soldiers . ''
okay , first of all , he thinks it’s a good press announcement .
it’s not .
50 soldiers – that’s not a lot even though they’re the _UNK_ .
but those 50 soldiers because of that announcement have a target on their heart .
they have a target on their heart .
why does he have to say that for ?
why can’t he let 50 soldiers go there quietly , _UNK_ , _UNK_ ?
why can’t he just do that ?
why can’t he do that ?
those 50 soldiers are in grave danger today because of that , and they probably don’t even know that but everybody is looking for them and that’s the way it is .
we have people that don’t know what they’re doing .
we used to have general _UNK_ – _UNK_ _UNK_ – general george patton .
i mean , these were real people .
these were real people .
today , we have generals that go on talk shows ... i saw a general the other day on a talk show .
he said – and this was serious and he’s a good man .
they’re good men .
but you’ve got to lead these men .
even the generals have to have some power over them .
he said , `` we are in the worst shape in terms of _UNK_ that we’ve been in in decades . ''
and this is the time when we have to be in the best shape because the world wants to kill us .
and he said we are in the worst shape we’ve been in many , many decades .
now , number one , he shouldn’t be saying that because you’re telling the enemy that and the enemy feels embolden when they hear that .
right ?
we shouldn’t be saying it .
we shouldn’t be saying it .
i mean , even if it’s true , you don’t say it .
you get it fixed and you do the opposite .
one thing i’m going to do i’ll tell you , i’m going to build our military so big and so strong and so powerful – so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us .
nobody is going to mess with us .
you know in many ways , it’s the cheapest thing you can do .
everyone is _UNK_ with us right now .
it’s the cheapest thing you can do .
the absolute cheapest thing you can do .
... i’m a big second amendment person by the way .
... my sons are really great _UNK_ .
they’re big _UNK_ .
and i’m a member of the nra but i’m not such a good shot .
but they’re great shots so it’s one of those things .
but if you think about that question .
so you know there’s tremendous pressure to get rid of the guns , get rid of the magazines , no bullets .
how about the one where they have three bullets in every magazine ?
... so the people will put three bullets in .
i don’t think the bad guys are going to say , `` well , i don’t want to break the law .
i’m going to go kill people today but i’m going to put three bullets in . ''
right ?
these people – and you know i have arguments with them all the time and i’m a practical guy .
honestly , if i didn’t believe this , i couldn’t say it .
so in france or in california , i have a _UNK_ to carry , which is a big thing in new york .
it’s very hard to get .
i have a _UNK_ to carry .
but in france or in california or in all these places where we see the _UNK_ , right , if instead of having like in france hundreds of people in that room – paris has the toughest gun laws in the world .
france has the toughest gun laws in the world .
nobody has guns .
except the bad guys .
so they walk in with the worst , the toughest , the best _UNK_ you could have and they said , `` over here – boom .
over here – boom . ''
so they killed _UNK_ but many more are dying right now .
they’re in terrible shape in the hospitals .
they just wipe the place out and they _UNK_ stayed there for longer .
they wiped it out .
then you had those two _UNK_ _UNK_ from california .
the married couple .
i saw the press – `` the young married couple that did the shooting '' .
they’re not a young married couple .
they’re the worst .
they’re _UNK_ .
... they say `` the young married couple '' .
that’s no young married couple .
so they walk into a place and they killed 14 people and others are going to be dying probably because of a lot of other wounded people .
but if somebody had guns in there – nobody had a gun ... how would you have done if you had a gun ?
would you have been _UNK_ back a little bit ?
they’d been in trouble .
right ?
they would have been in trouble .
believe me .
that guy .
so , you know , i went to like an _UNK_ league college and i have a lot of friends that are against guns and i argue with them .
i talk to them .
i said , `` okay , we’re in paris .
you have all these places and there’s hundreds of people .
guys walk in with guns and you have no gun .
don’t you think they _UNK_ been better if they had ? ''
they can’t – they lose the argument but they never change their mind .
so we have to fight for the second amendment .
it’s so simple .
it’s so simple .
and believe me , believe me , they want to take those guns away and you always know that the bad ones are going to have the guns and they’re going to have them more so than ever before .
so we’re going to protect the second amendment if i’m president .
that i can tell you .
and by the way , we’re going to be saying _UNK_ christmas again .
do you ever notice ?
... and by the way , _UNK_ christmas everybody .
_UNK_ christmas .
and happy holiday .
frankly , i have a lot of friends that aren’t christian .
they like christmas .
everybody likes christmas .
it’s politically _UNK_ to say _UNK_ christmas .
but when i’m president , _UNK_ christmas , happy holidays , enjoy yourselves , don’t eat too much turkey .
right ?
okay , so we’re going to say _UNK_ christmas again folks .
we’re going to bring that spirit back .
... i really do .
i like ted cruz a lot .
and he’s doing well .
i’m doing well .
i mean , it’s not a contest between the two of us , just so we understand .
we have to make that – but i do like him .
and i would say that we would certainly have things in mind for ted , to be honest with you .
i mean , he’s somebody that i can certainly see that because i like him , he likes me .
he actually put out a _UNK_ tonight .
he said `` donald trump is '' – i think he used the word – `` terrific '' .
that’s a nice word .
i mean , whoever _UNK_ that ?
i can tell you other candidates are not exactly saying that about me .
right ?
... ... so the _UNK_ _UNK_ are _UNK_ and i had many set up for me by people i didn’t know .
i mean , i’d see them on television talking about – somebody named one `` the _UNK_ of the deal _UNK_ '' .
two young guys .
they look good .
i mean , i don’t know .
but then i got to be , you know , started going around and i see the corruption with these _UNK_ _UNK_ , with the stuff towards money .
people that put the money in are dealing with the candidates .
the whole thing is wrong .
and i see it .
i mean , bush has $ _UNK_ million .
think of it .
$ _UNK_ million .
by the way , if he had $ 2 billion it wouldn’t make any difference .
okay ?
but bush has $ _UNK_ million .
and honestly , he’s a nice person .
he is .
i don’t want to do that but he’s a very nice person .
but it’s $ _UNK_ million .
and you’d say to yourself , `` people give $ 2 million , $ 5 million , $ 7 million .
you know what’s happening . ''
but some of the _UNK_ _UNK_ are running campaigns .
they’re actually running the campaign .
another thing and it’s sort of interesting , one of the _UNK_ _UNK_ i believe has $ 6 million .
of the $ 6 million – this was reported on the front page of the los _UNK_ times – one of the candidates who’s a nice person so i’m not going to mention the name .
you know , when i like people i like them .
i’m a very loyal person .
of the $ 6 million after all of the _UNK_ took their cuts , the _UNK_ – can you believe this ?
– they had $ _UNK_ left for the campaign .
that’s better than being a real _UNK_ _UNK_ .
i’d rather do that than sell houses .
$ _UNK_ left .
that was in the newspaper .
i don’t know .
i think i believe it .
but i’ve seen it .
i saw it with the romney campaign .
guys made tens of millions of dollars raising money for romney .
i said what the hell is this ?
i mean , you give money and they get a cut .
look , our laws are so corrupt .
our campaign finance laws are so _UNK_ corrupt .
it’s so _UNK_ .
so _UNK_ .
and i don’t necessarily want to stop people from giving because i think that’s a good thing but you have to get away from these _UNK_ .
what you have to have is people have to know who it is .
so you have to open up the process .
let people know .
if somebody wants to give $ 1 million , you give $ 1 million but everybody has to know that so and so gave $ 1 million because that puts a little pressure on guys like brad who raises hundreds of millions .
puts a little pressure .
but the concept of the _UNK_ is no good .
it’s no good .
it’s a very dangerous , terrible thing .
so we will change our laws because you really have no choice .
it’s so out of control .
it’s so terrible .
but the papers that are in this room tonight , they should look at this .
there’s so little money left over for the candidates , it’s one of the reasons why i’m so happy i’m doing my own .
we actually sent legal letters to either nine or 11 _UNK_ .
the trump _UNK_ , the trump _UNK_ , the this _UNK_ .
first of all , i’m sure that out of some of them they stole the money .
some guy has no money .
he sets up a trump something _UNK_ .
nothing to do with me .
sets it up .
all of a sudden he’s got $ 2 million sitting there .
right ?
people send in money .
and that guy has no money .
how much of that money do you think he’s going to use to do what he’s supposed to be doing ?
that’s common sense .
so maybe all of it but i doubt it .
so we sent legal notices to every one that we could find .
we don’t want their money .
we said `` don’t do it .
we don’t want it .
and we want _UNK_ to give the money back to the people that gave it to you . ''
but the _UNK_ _UNK_ concept is corrupt .
it’s terrible and it should be ended .
and we’re going to go to new campaign finance laws that are going to be terrific .
okay ?
thank you .
... well , look he’s [ _UNK_ to cruz ] from texas .
to the best of my knowledge , there’s a lot of oil in texas .
right ?
so you know , he gets a lot of money from the oil companies and he’s _UNK_ against _UNK_ and everything else you’re talking about .
and i’m not .
i’m _UNK_ in favor .
and you know , it’s a big industry here .
it’s a big industry .
you know , if that industry is _UNK_ , _UNK_ got problems .
i was _UNK_ .
i was here three weeks ago with the group ... they were such amazing people ... and i learned so much about it .
i was in favor of it even before ... ... beyond even the fuel _UNK_ , which we want to create as much as we can , tremendous numbers of jobs in iowa .
and i said to myself , if ted cruz is against _UNK_ , how does he win in iowa ?
because that’s very _UNK_ .
i don’t know how he _UNK_ in iowa .
i don’t know .
no , but i’m _UNK_ for it .
okay ?
thank you .
... i was a member of the _UNK_ six months ago .
i gave $ _UNK_ to the _UNK_ .
that’s the republican governors association .
i gave tremendous amounts of money away .
i was like the fair _UNK_ boy .
once i said i’m running , they said `` what ?
you’re not supposed to run . ''
and then what happened – i ran against all these senators and governors .
and everyone said `` well , i don’t know . ''
my wife said `` if you run , you’re going to win '' because she understands that i like people – i love people and people love me .
and she said `` you will run but you actually have to go and run .
you have to announce you’re running because _UNK_ going to believe you’re running . ''
and so i didn’t want to announce because i didn’t want to like announce and things didn’t work out and i’m like some of these guys where they’re zero .
many of them zero .
and so finally i said , `` look , let’s – we’re going to do it .
we have to do it . ''
just too many things that i watch on television with our president and the decisions that are made – _UNK_ – where we get _UNK_ and they get five killers .
we get this _UNK_ , dirty _UNK_ _UNK_ – _UNK_ _UNK_ .
we get this _UNK_ , terrible _UNK_ and they get five killers that they’ve wanted for nine years – the worst killers – and they’re all back on the battlefield .
you know , so many decisions .
the iran deal .
the iran deal .
how bad is that ?
they _UNK_ .
`` okay , good .
we’re not building .
we promise we’re not building nuclear weapons . ''
`` oh , okay .
that’s okay . ''
and we give them $ 150 billion and we don’t even get our prisoners back .
the whole thing is _UNK_ .
so i saw this .
and i said to my wife , `` hey , i don’t know if i’ll do well or not .
who the hell knows ? ''
and it’s a risky thing .
and i’ve always heard if you’re a very successful person you can’t run for office , especially for president , and i see it all the time .
and the people go after me .
i don’t even care at this point .
i said , `` i have to do it .
now , we’re going to have to do it . ''
and i look at it last time with romney and i didn’t do it and i probably should have because he let us down .
i mean , look , he let us down .
that was an election – we had a failed president .
four years ago he was a failed president , just as bad as he is now .
it’s true .
and romney let us down .
that last month – it was like he wasn’t even campaigning .
i said , `` why aren’t you on jay _UNK_ ?
why aren’t you on david _UNK_ ?
why aren’t you doing it ? ''
and he just didn’t do it .
so he lost the election .
so i backed mccain , he lost .
i backed romney , he lost .
this time i said i’m doing it myself , okay ?
we’re going to win .
we’re going to win .
but there is an _UNK_ out there .
it’s a real _UNK_ .
real people .
and they’re people that are used to having their little _UNK_ all over the place .
and they’re people that are used to giving _UNK_ and having control .
and they’re people that , you know , look when they call me i’ll treat them with respect but i’m not going to be doing bad things if it’s bad for the country .
i’m not going to let ford build a plant in mexico if i can keep it in michigan .
and i’m not going to let the car companies and _UNK_ and all these people and all these companies – i’m all for free trade .
i think it’s great .
i’m for it .
but it’s got to be smart trade .
i’m not going to let them move to mexico and then sell stuff over the border with no tax , no nothing so we lose our jobs , we lose our factories , they go over here , they make it , we let them come through .
how does that help us , folks ?
i went to the best business school in the world .
believe me , it doesn’t help us .
okay ?
trust me .
and we’re not going to make deals like that anymore .
we can’t .
we owe $ 19 trillion .
we can’t .
so the _UNK_ is not ever probably – look , you know what ?
in the end , if this country starts _UNK_ even the _UNK_ they’ll be saying `` okay , it’s a good thing '' because they’ll be _UNK_ also .
but we do have a real _UNK_ and they’ve never seen this happen before .
a _UNK_ called up and he said recently – i told this story .
i mean , one of the top journalists to my way of thinking certainly in the country and beyond .
and he said , `` mr. trump , how does it feel ? ''
i said , `` how does what feel ? ''
`` how does it feel ?
what you’ve done has never , ever been done before ? ''
i said , `` what have i done ? ''
`` you’ve dominated the summer of trump . ''
now they call it the _UNK_ of trump .
hopefully , they’re going to call it the spring of trump and i want the next _UNK_ of trump .
but i said to the _UNK_ , `` i don’t know what you’re talking about .
i haven’t done anything _UNK_ frankly if i don’t win i consider this to be a total waste of time . ''
i’ll be honest with you .
as much as i like being with you tonight .
because we won’t be able to do anything .
he said , `` no , no .
you’ve won even if you don’t win .
you’ve won already . ''
i said , `` no , you’re wrong .
if i don’t win , i have wasted my time . ''
so you know , the point is that the _UNK_ can’t believe it because they’ve never seen it happen before .
... i was on the cover of time magazine four or five weeks ago and time magazine was going to pick the person of the year .
everybody – even my enemies – said `` trump is going to win . ''
i said , `` i won’t win . ''
they said , `` why ? ''
`` i won’t win .
just like i should have gotten the _UNK_ for the _UNK_ for the first three years .
i was _UNK_ .
i should have . ''
and i said , `` i’ll never win . ''
i told everybody i’ll never win because i’m not _UNK_ _UNK_ .
and with time magazine , i said – bill _UNK_ , who’s a great guy , did an _UNK_ at the end of his show two days ago saying nobody has done more than trump , he should have won .
now , i’m not saying i should have – yeah , i probably should have in all fairness – but he said `` _UNK_ done more '' – you know , taking over – what we’ve done has been amazing – all of us together not just me .
it’s all of us .
it’s all of us .
from dallas and mobile and oklahoma .
all of us .
because the spirit .
... well , merkel got it .
now , merkel , what did she do ?
she’s destroyed – i mean , she’s in the process of destroying germany with the _UNK_ .
we have to help the people with the _UNK_ .
we have to create a safe zone some place in syria .
but i don’t want them coming into this country .
i don’t want them because we don’t know who they are .
we don’t know who they are .
them with their _UNK_ press that now do the forged _UNK_ .
okay ?
you heard about that .
so we don’t know .
the bottom line on that – it’s such an interesting question .
you’ll know in about a month or two whether or not the _UNK_ has treated me fairly .
but the only thing i can say is this : if i win iowa , i think it’s over .
i said before .
because i think if i win iowa , new hampshire is amazing .
people are amazing .
you would love the people .
they would love you .
you’d love everybody .
the whole country is in love ... i call it the noisy majority .
it’s no longer a silent majority .
it’s the noisy majority .
but if we win like i think we’re going to win because we have such a big league , honestly , it’s not going to matter .
they can’t do anything .
i don’t care about the _UNK_ .
they can’t do anything .
you know , the only way they can do is if i’m a little bit short , if i’m two votes short i have a problem because i’ll have to go into that convention , i’m dealing with all these blood _UNK_ politicians and they’ll make their deals and they’ll have all their money guys around and they’ll be in the _UNK_ making deals .
but if i get the number of delegates , there’s not a thing they can do .
and i’ll end up doing fine with the _UNK_ ... ... i’m such a _UNK_ in education .
you know , i had an uncle who was a professor at _UNK_ who was a brilliant guy ... in fact , i just _UNK_ an article about him today .
you’ve got to read it .
okay ?
_UNK_ _UNK_ .
you have to read it .
when i see somebody like _UNK_ – no i’ll tell you one thing i respect .
he didn’t change his views .
he knew he was getting killed on this issue and he didn’t change .
and i respect that to a certain extent .
but it’s so wrong .
common core is a total disaster .
we have people – bureaucrats in washington – telling you how your child should be educated in iowa and new hampshire and all of the different places that we go to .
it’s _UNK_ .
and i go around and i’ve seen the principals .
i’ve seen so many students and teachers and professors and principals , and i’ve seen some of the people and the love – even in iowa at a school – i’ve seen some of the love these parents give to those schools .
this is real love .
these are smart people .
and these are people that aren’t working for a paycheck .
these are incredible people ... remember this : our educational system is a mess .
we spend more money per _UNK_ as a government than any other country in the world and we’re in _UNK_ place .
and i mean like double what anybody else pays .
so i want to bring education back to the local areas .
you’re going to have parents and you’re going to have _UNK_ talented people and they love their kids and they want their kids to be _UNK_ because it’s so important .
and you’re going to be very happy with it .
okay ?
thank you .
thank you .
... you people do it .
we’re _UNK_ you 100 % ... we are _UNK_ you 100 % .
you’re doing a _UNK_ job .
there should be more people like you in this country .
you know , the whole grid is a disaster .
right ?
the whole country .
the infrastructure of our country is falling apart .
and nobody can build like me .
it’s what i do .
i build .
i build .
i’m building on – as you know – pennsylvania avenue a big tremendous _UNK_ that i got from the government of the united states .
can you believe it ?
during the obama administration a couple of years ago .
but we had the best plan .
the _UNK_ is terrific .
they’re very good .
actually , they’re very talented people .
we’re _UNK_ and ahead of schedule .
that’s what we do .
when you see these things where they’re building a bridge and it’s going to cost , you know , $ 1 billion and it costs $ 12 billion .
how about when they build a hospital and it costs $ 3 billion ?
and i look at it – i’m very good – i can look at a building and tell you how much it’s going to cost .
i say `` $ 250 million . ''
`` no , sir , $ 3 billion . ''
$ 3 billion ?
think somebody got rich on that one ?
so we’re going to stop all this stuff .
we’re going to make our country so strong and so wonderful .
and we all love it _UNK_ .
we love it .
but it’s so _UNK_ to see what’s happening .
it’s so _UNK_ .
and we’re going to change it around .
... we have such a problem .
and the biggest problem i have , you know , it _UNK_ to education and the hardest thing you get is when you go around and you’d see students and so many students come out to hear us and they always want to talk about the loans – they have student loans – and they’re going through nice colleges , they’re good students , they work hard , they could be really top in their class and they get out and they say , `` mr. trump , we have no jobs .
we can’t get jobs . ''
so they’re borrowed up to the _UNK_ and they can’t get jobs .
we’re going to bring our jobs back from china .
we’re going to bring our jobs back from all these places overseas that have stolen our jobs .
we’re going to bring our jobs back from south america .
we’re bringing them back from mexico .
we’re going to have jobs again .
believe me .
we’re going to be manufacturers again .
we’re going to start making apple computers in this country .
what the hell good does it do to make them in china ?
i want to make them in this country and we have the ability to do it .
so , we’re going to bring our jobs back .
okay ?
_UNK_ !
thank you very much .
hello .
i’d like to begin by thanking the people of _UNK_ , south dakota , new mexico , new jersey , and california .
we had some big , big days and we have some big numbers coming in .
very big numbers .
i’m truly honored by your support .
together , we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is .
we’re only getting started and it’s going to be beautiful .
remember that .
tonight , we close one chapter in history and we begin another .
our campaign received more primary votes than any _UNK_ campaign in history .
no matter who it is , no matter who they are , we received more votes .
this is a great feeling .
that’s a great feeling .
this is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change , not obama change , but real change is possible .
you’ve given me the honor to lead the republican party to victory this fall .
we’re going to do it .
we’re going to do it , folks .
we’re going to do it .
i understand the responsibility of carrying the _UNK_ and i will never , ever let you down .
too much work , too many people , blood , sweat , and tears .
i’m never going to let you down .
i will make you proud of your party and our movement , and that’s what it is – it’s a movement .
now , recent polls have shown that i’m _UNK_ hillary clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she’s made and she has made tremendous mistakes , we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially .
to everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign , i want to thank you .
i want to thank you very , very much .
to those who voted for someone else in either party , i will work hard to earn your support and i will work very hard to earn that support .
to all of those _UNK_ _UNK_ voters who have been left out in the cold by a _UNK_ system of _UNK_ delegates , we welcome you with open arms .
and by the way , the terrible trade deals that _UNK_ was so _UNK_ against – and he’s right on that – will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible .
and that’s what i do .
we are going to have _UNK_ trade deals .
we’re going to start making money and bringing in jobs .
now , i know some people say i’m too much of a fighter .
my preference is always peace , however .
and i’ve shown that .
i’ve shown that for a long time .
i’ve built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved – always .
my goal is always again to bring people together .
but i’m forced to fight for something i really care about , i will never , ever back down and our country will never , ever back down .
i’ve fought for my family .
i’ve fought for my business .
i’ve fought for my employees .
and now i’m going to fight for you – the american people – like nobody has ever fought before .
and i’m not a politician fighting .
i’m me .
you’re going to see some real good things happen .
just remember this : i’m going to be your champion .
i’m going to be america’s champion .
because , you see , this election isn’t about republican or democrat .
it’s about who runs this country – the special interests or the people – and i mean the american people .
every election year politicians promised change .
obama promised change and it didn’t work out too well .
and every year , they failed to deliver .
why would politicians want to change a system that’s _UNK_ _UNK_ in order to keep them in power ?
that’s what they’re doing , folks .
why would politicians want to change a system that’s made them and their friends very , very wealthy ?
i beat a _UNK_ system by winning with overwhelming support – the only way you could have done it – _UNK_ all over the country with every _UNK_ , on track to win _UNK_ _UNK_ victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people .
after years of _UNK_ , there’s one thing we all have learned – we can’t fix the _UNK_ system by relying on very – and i mean this so , so strongly – on the very people who _UNK_ it .
and they _UNK_ it and do not ever think anything differently .
we can’t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems .
the _UNK_ have turned the politics of personal _UNK_ into an _UNK_ form for themselves .
they’ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access , selling favors , selling government contracts , and i mean hundreds of millions of dollars .
secretary clinton even did all of the work on a _UNK_ illegal private _UNK_ .
something that how she’s getting away with this folks nobody understands .
designed to keep her corrupt _UNK_ out of the public record , putting the security of the entire country at risk , and a president in a corrupt system is _UNK_ protecting her .
not right .
i am going to give a major speech on probably monday of next week , and we’re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the _UNK_ .
i think you’re going to find it very _UNK_ and very , very interesting .
i wonder if the press would want to attend .
who knows ?
hillary clinton turned the state department into a private hedge fund .
the russians , the _UNK_ , the chinese all gave money to bill and hillary and got _UNK_ treatment in return .
it’s a _UNK_ day in america when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens .
i didn’t need to do this .
it’s not easy .
believe me .
i didn’t need to do it .
but i felt i had to give back to our wonderful country , which has been so good to me and to my family .
i’ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people’s lives .
i’ve visited communities in new york , new jersey , pennsylvania , connecticut , indiana , and ohio whose manufacturing jobs – they literally these jobs have virtually disappeared .
an _UNK_ to our country and it’s _UNK_ .
i’ve embraced the victims of illegal immigration – moms and dads who have had to _UNK_ their own children because of people that shouldn’t have been in the country .
remember it , folks .
remember it .
i’ve visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools .
i’ve seen our _UNK_ airports , highways , bridges , and i’ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far _UNK_ to ours .
it’s really not to be believed .
hard to imagine what’s happened to our country .
america is getting taken apart piece by piece , _UNK_ off , and just rapidly _UNK_ off to the highest _UNK_ .
we’re broke .
we’re broke .
we owe $ 19 trillion .
going quickly to $ _UNK_ trillion .
our infrastructure is a disaster .
our schools are failing .
crime is rising .
people are scared .
the last thing we need is hillary clinton in the white house or an extension of the obama disaster .
what a crowd .
what a crowd .
thank you all very much .
we love our country .
we love our country .
but we can turn this all around .
we’re going to do it by putting america first .
that commitment is the foundation for change that’s been missing and it’s been missing for a long time .
it’s important to understand what america first means .
it means on foreign policy , we will never enter into any conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation .
it has to make us safer as a nation .
this is the opposite of _UNK_ foreign policy , which _UNK_ libya , _UNK_ iraq , unleashed isis and threw syria into chaos and created the mass _UNK_ , which is _UNK_ _UNK_ all over the world and while putting iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a _UNK_ power in the middle east .
and they are _UNK_ and we have made them that way , folks , we have made them that way .
better hope i’m president .
on trade , america first means the american worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition – what’s happening here is absolutely a _UNK_ .
no _UNK_ [ sic ] .
you’re right about that .
so and you mean no _UNK_ .
we are going – and remember this – we are only going to have great trade deals .
okay ?
we are only going to have that .
we’re not going to _UNK_ as somebody just said the trans-pacific partnership , which is a disaster – a disaster – for our country .
almost as bad as _UNK_ signed by bill clinton , which has just _UNK_ our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places and in particular mexico .
if it’s not a great deal for our country , we will not sign it .
it’s got to be great for our country , for our community , for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we’re suffering big league and it’s getting worse .
on energy policy , america first means opening up america’s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers , including our wonderful and hardworking miners who have been absolutely _UNK_ _UNK_ by this administration .
on economic policy , america first means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the united states , substantially lowering taxes for middle class americans and businesses .
likewise , regulation which is _UNK_ our economy which would be brought down from its present _UNK_ level , we will make it very , very good for our companies , for our small businesses , and for people that want to survive and do well in our country .
on immigration policy , america first means protecting the jobs , wages , and security of american workers .
whether first or _UNK_ generation , no matter who you are , we’re going to protect your job because let me tell you , our jobs are being _UNK_ from our country like we’re _UNK_ .
the beauty of america first is that it brings us all together .
every american worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits , protections and rights and _UNK_ .
it’s got to be that way .
now , the people in charge say things can’t change .
i’m here today to tell you that we have to change .
we have no choice .
we have to change .
we’re going to put america back to work .
we’re going to make our own products .
we’re going to put america back to work .
we’re going to rebuild our inner cities , which are absolutely a shame and so _UNK_ , going to take care of our african-american people that have been _UNK_ for so long .
we’re going to make you and your families safe , secure , and prosperous .
prosperous again .
together , we will put the american people first again .
first again .
we will make our communities wealthy .
we will make our cities safe again .
we will make our country strong again .
ladies and gentlemen , we will make america great again !
remember .
thank you !
thank you !
thank you very much everybody !
thank you , everybody .
thank you very much .
this has been a great period of time .
it’s been really amazing .
we’ve gotten the nomination .
we’re going to have an incredible period in cleveland .
we look forward to it .
we’ve started working already on the convention .
and _UNK_ , good luck in the series because we’re going to have the series , which of course the longer it goes the less time we have but that’s okay .
and it’s going to be very interesting to see what happens .
but as you know , they’re playing the basketball _UNK_ _UNK_ in that _UNK_ so i think it will be very exciting .
_UNK_ add to the _UNK_ in cleveland and that’s good .
that’s what we want because it’s going to be an exciting period of time .
we have – we’ve done some _UNK_ good work .
i was just informed ... that we’ve got more votes than anybody in the history of the republican _UNK_ and we still have i guess six or seven _UNK_ to go , states to go .
and in the history , think of it , in the history of this great party , we’ve gotten substantially more votes than anybody else by millions – by many millions more – than anybody who’s ever run .
so that’s a great .
you know , when you think dwight eisenhower and ronald reagan and everybody , we have the most votes by far .
so that’s something to me that’s very exciting .
and overall , it’s just been a very exciting process .
i think we’re going to do very well .
we have no idea what’s going to happen on the _UNK_ side but they’re certainly having difficulty .
i don’t like to see people having difficulty .
but if anybody has to have it , let it be them .
and i think it’s going to be very interesting .
i’m very proud to say that we’ve gotten the most votes and also if you look at the overall primary the amount of votes cast , that’s also a record .
so we’ve broken a lot of records in terms of the voters .
our polling has come out and the polls are doing very well as you know .
we’re pretty much even and in some cases ahead of hillary .
and i think we’re going to have a very , very successful number of months .
and i think it will all _UNK_ in november and we’re going to make america great .
okay ?
so that’s the way it is ... i’m glad you asked the question because i have to tell you i have raised a tremendous amount of money for the vets – almost $ 6 million .
and more money is going to come in i believe over the next little while too .
but i’ve raised almost $ 6 million .
all of the money has been paid out and i’m going to give it to you in just a second .
in fact , i brought a list just in case that question was asked .
but the money has been paid out .
i have been thanked by so many _UNK_ groups throughout the united states .
one _UNK_ called me up recently _UNK_ that out of a blue he got a check for $ 100,000 .
i have been thanked by so many groups – great _UNK_ groups .
and by the way , outside you have a few people _UNK_ .
they’re sent there by hillary clinton and they’re _UNK_ that the money wasn’t sent .
the money has all been sent .
i wanted to keep it private .
if we could , i wanted to keep it private because i don’t think it’s _UNK_ business if i want to send money to the vets .
but i have to say this .
i raised close to $ 6 million .
_UNK_ probably be over that amount when it’s all said and done .
but as of this moment , it’s $ _UNK_ million .
when this started , it started with a speech in iowa when i said let’s raise some money for the vets and it went up from $ 1 million to $ 2 million to $ 3 million .
and it now ends up to be almost $ 6 million and again i think we can even do better than that .
but i will say that the press should be _UNK_ of themselves .
and behalf of the vets , the press should be _UNK_ of themselves .
they are calling me .
they are _UNK_ because i sent people checks of a lot of money .
we’re going to give you the names right now , which is what you want .
and instead of being like `` thank you very much , mr. trump '' or `` trump did a good job '' , everyone said , `` who got it ?
who got it ?
who got it ? ''
and you make me look very bad .
i have never received such bad _UNK_ for doing such a good job .
so i will give the names because that’s what you want .
right ?
okay .
are you ready ?
i brought them here .
it takes – because you have to _UNK_ each company .
you know , much of this money was paid out fairly early .
but you have to _UNK_ all of these different groups because these are many different groups .
you have to go through a process .
when you send checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars to people and to companies and to groups that you’ve never heard of – _UNK_ organizations .
you have to _UNK_ it .
you send people out .
you do a lot of work .
now , most of the money went out quite a while ago .
some of it went out more recently .
but all of this has gone out and i’ll give you the names .
are you ready ?
do you have your _UNK_ ?
and again , i really think the press – look , the media , you know my opinion of the media .
it’s very low .
i think the media is frankly made up of people that , in many cases , not in all cases , are not good people .
but i think this is an example .
and i just on behalf of all of the folks that have worked hard on this and all of the people that have made contributions , including myself ; i gave $ 1 million , but i just want to tell you that there are so many people that are so _UNK_ for what we did .
one other thing that’s important to know .
zero dollars have been taken out for administration .
you know , when you go to a lot of these different groups , in this case , zero dollars have been taken out for administration .
so a lot of these companies that make a lot of money doing the administration stuff .
so no money – it costs zero dollars to _UNK_ all of this money .
okay ?
so you have 22 kill and that’s $ 200,000 .
and you can call these people .
that was another thing .
a lot of the money when it was sent out , different people would call .
i could tell you , i’m not going to mention anybody specifically , but there were a couple of people that were really _UNK_ .
they’d call and these _UNK_ groups they don’t get a lot of calls from the press .
and maybe some of them would keep quiet or they didn’t know or they didn’t want to talk to the press or they didn’t feel comfortable .
so if they didn’t say they got the money , which they all did , 100 % got the money .
all _UNK_ checks .
if anyone wants to see the _UNK_ checks .
but rather than say why don’t you – could i see a _UNK_ check ?
they said `` well , they didn’t say they got the money . ''
they all got the money .
but they’re not people that always talk to the press .
many of them do talk to the press .
many of them have – i guess you found $ 2 million or $ 2.5 million where they talked .
well , the number is $ _UNK_ million and it’s going to possibly go above that because i believe some other people are coming in .
ready ?
_UNK_ got $ 200,000 .
now , these are checks that have been delivered , that have been _UNK_ , that are now being used to help the vets .
_UNK_ international – great organization – $ 200,000 .
much of this money was paid a long time ago .
american hero _UNK_ – $ 100,000 .
americans for equal living – $ 100,000 .
america’s _UNK_ – the _UNK_ _UNK_ corps _UNK_ – $ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ – $ _UNK_ .
just so you understand .
when i didn’t do the fox debate ... because i didn’t think they treated me right but actually they’ve been extremely fair over the last three or four months , i have to say that about fox .
but when i didn’t do that one event , the debate , i gave a speech .
i didn’t have to do this with the money for the vets but i decided to because i thought it would be a good idea .
and i had some very generous people – carl _UNK_ gave $ 500,000 .
_UNK_ _UNK_ gave $ 1 million ... _UNK_ _UNK_ gave $ 1 million .
we raised a lot of money .
and i didn’t have to do that .
it would have been easier just to give the speech .
and the problem with the press what they do is they convince people like me not to do it , not to give money to different things because it’s a lot easier actually that way .
and i believe we’re going to have some more coming in .
some friends of mine , some more coming in .
and that adds up to $ _UNK_ total and we’re going to have some more coming in .
now , every one of those checks have been passed other than the one check which is being held subject to they’re getting a final approval from the government .
but every one of those has been passed .
this is my check for $ 1 million .
we have many letters from the different groups thanking us very much for the money and they didn’t ask – i didn’t ask people to be here today .
i could have asked every one of the group unlike hillary who asks people to stand outside and say `` donald trump didn’t give the money . ''
nobody gave this kind of money .
so i gave $ _UNK_ .
more is coming in .
probably _UNK_ the $ 6 million number .
i never thought we were going to raise $ 1 million when we started .
and we end up doing almost $ 6 million .
i have to tell you the press is so _UNK_ and so unfair .
a lot of the people behind me and some of the people over here helped in _UNK_ the various _UNK_ for money .
and i just want to thank all of those people .
i wasn’t too involved in _UNK_ the organizations other than to the marine law enforcement .
they are _UNK_ people .
they honored me last year at the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
i knew them .
i was going to give it to three companies or three groups and we couldn’t _UNK_ them quickly .
and so i gave it to the marine .
and if you look at number , the marine corps law enforcement foundation is a _UNK_ group and i didn’t have to go through a big _UNK_ process with them .
because i was going to _UNK_ the $ 1 million check up _UNK_ ... and in the end i just didn’t want to go through the process of having to _UNK_ all those different groups .
because i wanted to make this out of the goodness of my heart .
i didn’t want to do this where the press is all involved and all of a sudden everybody is going `` where did it go ?
who did it go to ? ''
then we said who it went to , then we said how much was it .
... look , when this started ... i said if we could raise $ 1 million that would be good .
and we ended up raising almost $ 6 million .
and i’m going to have more coming in over a period of time .
i’m _UNK_ accountable but i didn’t want to have credit for it .
actually though what i got was worse than credit because they were questioning me .
and this is money .
and by the way , most of that money went out very early just so you understand .
but a lot of these groups – getting _UNK_ by , you know , when you pay the money out , they need government _UNK_ .
they need a lot of different things .
plus , we want to find out who’s in the good group .
i had people – teams of people – reviewing statistics , reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was _UNK_ of the money .
we have given to groups that are _UNK_ groups .
and honestly , i wish you could hear the phone calls and see the letters .
they are so happy .
and i’m happy to do it .
i didn’t want the credit for it but it was very unfair that the press treated us so badly .
well , generally speaking , that’s 100 % true .
i like scrutiny .
but you know what ?
when i raise money – excuse me , excuse me , i’ve watched you on television .
you’re a real beauty .
when i raise money for the veterans and it’s a massive amount of money – find out how much hillary clinton has given to the veterans – nothing .
and then i see a few guys standing out there .
they don’t even know what they’re there for .
they have no idea .
they’re there because hillary _UNK_ campaign sent them .
and actually i think it was you or one of you that found out that they actually were with hillary _UNK_ campaign , which was interesting but i wasn’t surprised .
i don’t want the credit for it but i shouldn’t be _UNK_ .
and remember this : so out of the almost $ 6 million that was raised not one penny did i take for administration cost .
that’s _UNK_ of .
how else am i going to raise the money ?
how else am i going to raise the money ?
i would have given – just so you understand .
until i was _UNK_ – so i’m the only one in the world that could raise almost $ 6 million for the veterans , have uniform applause by the _UNK_ groups , and end up being _UNK_ by the press .
yes , i made a speech and during the speech i said , `` let’s raise a little money for the vets . ''
it turned out to be a lot of money , not a little money .
i thought if we could get to $ 1 million , it would be great , which it would have been .
that’s right .
i do raise millions .
no , i don’t think so .
no , i raised almost $ 6 million .
some of it didn’t come through .
but more money is coming through than didn’t come through .
the number probably is going to be – when we finish it probably going to be over the $ 6 million .
i don’t mind it coming from the opposition ... what i do mind is when i raise all of these millions and when we started out nobody ever thought it was going to be over $ 5 million or close to $ 6 [ million ] .
so , look , here’s the story .
here’s the story .
i think and i’ve been dealing with the press a long time .
i think the political press is among the most _UNK_ people i’ve ever met , i have to tell you that .
okay ?
... but i think the political press ... i think the political press – i see the stories and i see the way they’re attached .
for instance , i went down this weekend to do rolling _UNK_ .
i was invited .
i didn’t have anything to do with it .
we had a tremendous gathering of people – thousands – i don’t know how many thousands – but many thousands of people .
and i _UNK_ `` oh , i thought we were going to go from the jefferson memorial to the – `` i was _UNK_ .
they said `` donald trump was _UNK_ '' .
everybody knew i was being _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
they said some of them .
said donald trump was very _UNK_ that it didn’t go from jefferson to lincoln .
you know , millions of people .
i was _UNK_ .
i said `` oh , i’m used to watching it .
we had – `` i was _UNK_ .
so they put it down as serious .
they know i was _UNK_ .
i’ll give you another example .
we had a certain – same event – it was _UNK_ off where you could only get so many people there and there were a lot of people .
i don’t know – 10,000 , 15,000 , maybe _UNK_ i don’t know there was a lot of people .
plus there were people breaking the _UNK_ all the way along .
_UNK_ washington , a man i like actually , wrote an article said there were 5,000 people there .
there were many times that .
and you weren’t allowed to have any more people .
and all of these people were with their _UNK_ in _UNK_ _UNK_ all the way .
they were waving to me as i’m going .
but wait a minute .
the point is law enforcement – these people didn’t allow you to have any more people .
... i had a tremendous crowd but it was the biggest crowd you could have had .
it was all _UNK_ off .
you weren’t allowed to have any more .
you weren’t allowed to have any more people than that .
so instead of saying trump made a speech in front of a _UNK_ crowd , they said `` trump was _UNK_ '' because i didn’t have millions of people going from jefferson to washington .
i mean , give me a break .
... honestly , it’s _UNK_ reporting .
well , the veterans believe me .
let me tell you , the veterans why they believe .
and i have group that i gave ... [ _UNK_ a veteran to speak ] ... i could have asked all these groups – he just showed up .
i just saw him .
but i could have asked all these groups to come here and they could have made – i didn’t want to do that .
i’m not looking for credit .
but what i don’t want is when i raise millions of dollars have people say like this _UNK_ guy over here from _UNK_ – he’s a _UNK_ in my book .
you’re a _UNK_ because you know the facts and you know the facts well .
veteran : thank you , mr. trump .
first of all for the record , i’m a state representative from new hampshire , 10 years on the veterans affairs committee , 22 years in the marine corps , _UNK_ first sergeant .
what i want to _UNK_ here first of all , i would never ever in a million years put my name on a candidate that did not from his heart look me in the eye and tell me he’s concerned about veterans .
that’s donald trump .
i met him over a year ago .
i’ve been involved in many _UNK_ .
there are many _UNK_ out there .
he did the right thing by _UNK_ these groups there .
if you look at some of the groups , they’re given 20 _UNK_ , 40 _UNK_ on the dollar and they’re spending the rest for you know their nice _UNK_ trips .
he gave 100 % .
the liberal media is the only ones that have been calling the foundation .
all right ?
i’m a former chairman .
i’ve been dealing with this stuff for years as a veterans _UNK_ .
stop using veterans as a political _UNK_ .
you’ve got a guy outside ... go do a google search on his facebook .
he’s out there .
his pictures with clinton .
they are using veterans as political _UNK_ .
it must stop .
donald trump is doing this with a heart .
you’re all focused on the way he’s raising money and you’re not looking at the 22 veterans that are killing each other everyday .
you’re not concerned about the thousands of veterans that are on _UNK_ .
look at his plans on his trump website .
he talks about medical cards .
he talks about fixing the va. he talks about competition .
i think the liberal media and i’ve been dealing with you a long time .
you need to get your head out of your _UNK_ .
focus on the real issues .
thank you .
what i did – i didn’t ask al .
i’ve gotten to know al a little bit primarily through new hampshire where we had great victories .
but he showed up this morning because he was _UNK_ .
and many of the other groups were _UNK_ .
they received $ 100,000 in the _UNK_ .
they didn’t even know what it was for .
it was from me .
other groups received $ 200,000 , $ 250,000 .
they didn’t know what it was for .
and again , _UNK_ i have received phones calls with people _UNK_ .
i have received letters – _UNK_ letters .
... the bad part about the _UNK_ of the media is that people like me will be _UNK_ not to do it anymore .
because why should you raise $ _UNK_ million and i think i’ll go over $ 6 million pretty easily .
nobody said that we started this out as a small little project where it was less than $ 1 million because it kept just _UNK_ and building and building .
but nobody talks about that .
so we raised $ _UNK_ million .
we have so many happy groups .
so many happy veterans .
and then i see these hillary clinton people outside .
now , of course , they don’t know the extent .
they probably figured based on reading the press that trump didn’t make , you know , didn’t raise this kind of money .
but we raised a lot and i’ll be raising more and we’ll be sending it to other people as we get along .
it’s a complicated process .
no , it doesn’t ... you know , the government sort of _UNK_ different groups for a lot of reasons .
so it really does – and more than anything else , it’s also speaking to other veterans .
we have a circle of veterans .
i don’t want to send a $ 250,000 check to a group that doesn’t do good work .
so it’s called _UNK_ .
we _UNK_ the vets .
but it’s called _UNK_ .
i think it’s _UNK_ because i love the vets and i’ve worked hard for the vets .
and as you can see , i’ve given a lot of money and raised a lot of money for the vets .
and i think when the press _UNK_ it differently , the press is being very _UNK_ .
so i don’t like that .
i don’t like _UNK_ .
jeff _UNK_ is a _UNK_ man .
jeff _UNK_ is one of the most highly respected people in the united states senate .
jeff _UNK_ is a person that i believe that ted cruz has the most respect for and i think ted thought that he would get an _UNK_ .
you know , jeff _UNK_ has never _UNK_ a presidential candidate before as many years as he’s been in the senate .
so you know , jeff _UNK_ is certainly somebody that i would consider .
absolutely .
he’s a _UNK_ person .
i think it was a very tough call .
it was amazing because there were moments with the _UNK_ the way he held that child that almost like a mother holding a baby – looks so beautiful and calm .
and there were moments where it looked pretty dangerous .
i don’t think they had a choice .
i mean , probably they didn’t have a choice .
you have a child , a young child , at stake .
you know , it’s too bad there wasn’t another way .
i thought it was so beautiful to watch that powerful almost 500 _UNK_ _UNK_ and the way he dealt with that little boy .
but it just takes one second .
it’s one second – it’s not like it takes place over – well , he’s going to do it 30 _UNK_ from now .
it just takes one little _UNK_ of his _UNK_ .
and i will tell you they probably had no choice .
... i’m entirely in favor of fixing the va health care .
va is one of the great _UNK_ in this country what’s going on .
you look at what’s happening in phoenix and different places throughout the country where they’re _UNK_ people _UNK_ and they don’t even fire them , where people are waiting five days , six days , seven days on line .
they’re dying while they wait on line .
and i am in favor of if they can’t get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time , they’re going to see a doctor and the country’s going to pay for it .
they’re going to go to a private doctor or a public hospital and a public doctor but some place that can take them immediately .
we’re losing thousands of people waiting on line .
and the veterans administration is run by obama just as _UNK_ as he’s running our country .
you look at the _UNK_ , you look at what’s going on at the airports and you look at that .
okay ?
just take a look at that .
that’s like the veterans administration .
nothing in our country works anymore .
it’s a mess .
and maybe that’s why i’m doing so well in the polls .
no , it doesn’t have to be _UNK_ .
no , it doesn’t have to be _UNK_ .
what it has to be is when _UNK_ on line and they say it’s going to be a seven day wait , that person is going to walk over to across the street to a private doctor , be taken care of .
we’re going to pay the bill .
and by the way , that’s going to be a lot less expensive .
and we’ll check it out and be careful .
but that’s going to be a lot less expensive than what’s going on .
these people are living in hell .
and hillary clinton said the veterans administration is working just fine .
and the head of it , [ bob ] _UNK_ said last week that waiting in line is not bad – look at _UNK_ world .
okay ?
these are the kind of people we have running things .
it’s _UNK_ .
... that’s their choice .
you have a party called the democrats and they’re going to have to make that choice .
i think it’s probably going to be her because it’s _UNK_ .
and i think if you people will say i’m the one that came up with the term `` _UNK_ '' .
i used it for myself , except that i won by such big _UNK_ that the whole system is _UNK_ on both sides .
with the republicans it’s less obvious .
with democrats with the whole _UNK_ _UNK_ thing , it’s _UNK_ .
so i think that they’re going to have to make that determination .
if you’re asking me who i prefer running against ?
i think what she did was very bad and i think a lot of people have done a lot less than her and their lives have been destroyed .
the judge has been very unfair .
has not done a good job .
he’s been a very bad judge .
has been very unfair .
and i will win the trump university case .
i already am as far as i’m concerned .
but i will win the trump university case .
because i don’t care ... i have a judge who’s very , very unfair .
well , you’ll see it in court documents .
but i have a judge who’s very , very unfair .
he knows he’s unfair .
and i’ll win the trump university case .
i can settle that case .
i could have settled it .
i just choose not to .
in fact , when i ran this , they said why didn’t you settle up that case ?
i don’t want to settle the case .
because you know what ?
because i’m a man of principle .
and most of the people that took those courses have letters saying they thought it was great essentially .
it was good .
it was great .
and you know what ?
when they’re on the stand and you say `` how come you signed the letter saying that trump university was so good ?
how come you signed the letter ? ''
the woman that was the original _UNK_ in the case – they went to the court and the judge allowed her to get out of the case .
the case should have been dropped .
the whole case should have been dropped .
they wanted her _UNK_ from the case .
you know why ?
because she was _UNK_ , she was such a bad witness that we’d win the case easily .
she signed a letter and she’s on film .
she’s on tape like these cameras saying _UNK_ good things about trump university .
so they didn’t want her anymore because she’s a disaster for them .
so they went to the judge and they said `` your honor , we’d like to have her not be a _UNK_ , not be a _UNK_ in the case . ''
and he said , `` oh , that’s okay . ''
she’s the one that started the case .
now , they don’t even want her to _UNK_ .
they don’t want her to _UNK_ because she’s a disaster .
she has all sorts of beautiful statements about it .
and importantly , she’s on tape saying how great it is .
they don’t want her .
i wouldn’t want her either .
now , i could have settled that case .
i could settle that case .
i can settle that case .
i don’t want to .
i’ll go through the process .
because we’re down the line .
because we’re down the line and the fact that you can’t win as independent .
for the most part , you can’t even get on texas and various other states now .
it’s too late .
but texas is out .
... here’s what happens .
what happens is you will not have – and very importantly – you will not have supreme court _UNK_ .
you’re going to lose .
you could have as many as four or five .
that’s over .
now , [ bill ] _UNK_ the one that’s – but he’s the last one .
don’t forget , he said `` trump will never run . ''
the _UNK_ not a smart person .
he said , `` donald trump would never run . ''
remember ?
you remember ?
i actually blame you .
why do you put this guy on television ?
i see him on the different shows .
he’s got no credibility .
said i won’t run .
if i run , i won’t do well .
if i do well , this and that .
he looks like such a _UNK_ .
i saw him on one show .
he’s _UNK_ _UNK_ because he can’t justify .
now he comes out with a _UNK_ over the weekend – over memorial day weekend – it sounds like he’s going to put somebody up .
even i thought it .
i thought , `` oh , they’re going to find _UNK_ . ''
now he comes out with something saying he was almost – almost – _UNK_ .
okay ?
let me tell you , these people are _UNK_ .
he’s trying to make you – he’s trying to drive you guys a little bit _UNK_ .
if they do an _UNK_ , assuming it’s decent , which i don’t think anybody with a reputation would do it because they’d look like _UNK_ .
but what you’re going to do is you lose the election for the republicans and therefore you lose the supreme court , therefore you will have a group of people put on the supreme court where this country will never ever recover .
it will never , ever be the same .
no , i didn’t say that .
i said bill _UNK_ is a _UNK_ and i’ll tell you why ... he has called every single move .
take a look – on me , he’s going to lose this state – i won in a _UNK_ ... i didn’t say everybody .
many .
i didn’t say everybody .
wait , wait , wait .
bill _UNK_ is a _UNK_ .
his magazine is failing , as you know .
it’s going to be down – i don’t think it even _UNK_ .
he’s getting some free _UNK_ .
but bill _UNK_ – i’ve been watching this for two years .
`` trump isn’t going to run . ''
then i go into a race , we go into new hampshire .
`` oh , he’s not going to win new hampshire . ''
i win in a _UNK_ .
every place i went i was not going to win .
but i win in a _UNK_ .
do you think maybe he doesn’t like me ?
it’s wrong .
it’s wrong .
i didn’t get 30 % .
my last score was _UNK_ % .
i didn’t get 30 % .
i don’t know .
no , no , no .
here’s the way i look at it .
when i have somebody that’s not on my side , when you know – by the way , i’ve gotten great applause from the press in terms of as an achievement because the republican party is really well unified .
we have come up .
people that you would have never thought possible are now saying , `` i support trump . ''
so remember that .
we don’t talk about that too much .
but actually last week , the big story was how fast the republican party is healing because it is a healing process .
it was a rough – that was a rough campaign ... i can this .
the real is how fast we’re getting together .
now , if i have a republican who’s not on my side , i’m not going to be – why should i be particularly nice to that person ?
i’m not going to go after it like i would hillary or _UNK_ _UNK_ .
but you know what ?
why should i be nice to that person if i have a person that’s not going to support me ?
i have no obligation .
politically , i may be right .
i may be wrong .
but that’s who i am .
i’m a very honest person ... if somebody is going to say a little bit negative or a lot negative about me and if they happen to be republican , i may choose to hit them back .
not always .
but i may choose to hit them back .
i’m not a fan of mitt romney .
mitt romney lost an election he should have won .
and if you read the front page of the wall street _UNK_ about mitt romney , he looks like a _UNK_ .
look , i’m not a fan of mitt romney .
just so you understand .
i raised a lot of money for mitt romney .
i made _UNK_ for mitt romney .
i made speeches for him .
he let us down .
if you read the front page of the wall street _UNK_ this weekend , mitt romney looks like a _UNK_ .
now , what would i say good about mitt romney ?
she was not nice and i was fine , just a little bit of a _UNK_ .
but she wasn’t nice .
and you think i’m going to change ?
i’m not changing , including with her .
bob _UNK_ is a fan of mine .
bob _UNK_ _UNK_ me .
so don’t tell me about bob _UNK_ .
well , look , gary johnson , he got 1 % of the vote last time .
i watched that whole situation .
it was pretty _UNK_ .
i think it’s a total _UNK_ deal .
i think he’s a _UNK_ candidate if you want to know the truth .
i look at him and i watch him and i watch his _UNK_ and i watch what he says .
i think that he is a _UNK_ candidate ... when you do a little research on that i think it’s not going to be a factor .
okay ?
no , not all of you .
just many of you .
yeah , it is .
yeah , it is .
let me tell you something .
i’m a person – yeah , it’s going to be like this ... if the press _UNK_ false stories like they did with this – half of you were _UNK_ that i raised all of this money .
if the press _UNK_ false stories like they did where i wanted to keep a low _UNK_ .
i didn’t want the credit for raising all this money for the vets .
i wasn’t looking for the credit .
and by the way , more money is coming in .
i wasn’t looking for the credit .
but i had no choice but to do this because the press was saying i didn’t raise any money for them .
not only did i raise it , much of it was given a long time ago .
and there is a _UNK_ process and i think you understand that .
but when i raise almost $ 6 million and probably in the end will raise more than six because more is going to come in and is coming in .
but when i raise $ _UNK_ million as of today , more is coming in .
and this is going to _UNK_ groups .
and i have many of these people _UNK_ the people getting the money and working hard .
and then we have to read probably _UNK_ stories or certainly close in the newspapers and the people know the stories are false , i’m going to continue to attack the press .
look , i find the press to be extremely _UNK_ .
i find the political press to be _UNK_ _UNK_ .
i will say that .
okay , thank you all very much .
thank you .
thank you very much .
well , thank you very much everyone .
i want to start by , as always , thanking my family .
my wife , _UNK_ .
my kids – they’re not kids anymore but they’re kids as far as i’m concerned .
they’ll always be my kids .
and i want to thank my great parents who are looking down right now and my brother looking down on us .
i want to thank my entire family , including _UNK_ , _UNK_ , robert .
and it’s been some _UNK_ day and evening and year .
i never have been through anything like this but it’s a beautiful thing to watch and a beautiful thing to _UNK_ , and we’re going to make america great again .
we’re going to make america great again .
so important – so important that the people of indiana have been incredible .
i started as you know not very long ago – about six weeks ago – and i was told that i had a 20 point deficit .
and i went there and i worked very hard and i campaigned and i made _UNK_ of speeches and met _UNK_ of incredible people – incredible people .
you don’t get better , and the crowds got bigger and bigger .
and toward the end , it was like i didn’t want to leave .
i almost said , `` maybe i’ll just never leave '' and it _UNK_ somehow and we have a tremendous victory tonight .
it was a tremendous victory .
and i have to thank bobby _UNK_ .
boy , bobby _UNK_ was incredible .
he was incredible .
i always that people like that – there aren’t many – but it’s called tough , smart , and they know how to win .
and that’s what our country needs .
we have to win again .
we have to know how to win .
and we haven’t won .
we’ve been losing all the time .
we lose with our military .
we can’t beat isis .
we lose with trade .
we lose with borders .
we lose everything .
we’re not going to lose .
we’re going to start winning again and we’re going to win big league .
believe me .
so when i got back tonight and i started watching all of the different networks , i could immediately that we were doing very well , and it really looks like a massive victory and it looks like we win all _UNK_ delegates .
and i must say in staying in various places in indiana , i turned on the television and all i saw was negative ads , negative one after another after another .
and i called my people and i said , `` how can we win ?
it’s just constantly . ''
it was the same as in florida .
you know , _UNK_ been _UNK_ negative ads .
i got it right from you folks , okay ?
_UNK_ in fact , two weeks ago it was _UNK_ now it’s _UNK_ negative ads – most of which are absolutely false and _UNK_ .
and i said how can anybody endure this ?
i had one evening two nights ago where literally they had five ads on in between _UNK_ of a show that i was watching .
and i said that’s just incredible .
and the people are so smart .
they don’t buy it .
they get it .
and it’s tremendous , tremendous amounts of money were spent – millions and millions of dollars .
and they were _UNK_ it .
they think it was probably $ 8 million was spent against me and we spent $ _UNK_ .
so , i mean , to me that’s the way it’s supposed to be .
that’s something that makes me feel really , really very good .
and now we’re going to _UNK_ where i have – i just hear we’re doing really _UNK_ .
i look forward to that very much .
and west virginia .
and we’re going to get those miners back to work .
i’ll tell you what .
we’re going to get those miners back to work .
we’re not going to be hillary clinton , and i watched her three or four weeks ago where she was talking about the miners as if they were just numbers and she was talking about she wants the mines closed and she will never let them work again .
let me tell you , the miners in west virginia and pennsylvania which was so great to me last week and ohio and all over , they’re going to start to work again .
believe me .
you’re going to be proud again to be miners .
so we’ll be going there .
i must say this tremendous run that we’ve had started with new york when we had almost _UNK_ % .
and don’t forget , that’s with three people .
so _UNK_ % with two people is a massive _UNK_ .
but _UNK_ % almost – just a little over _UNK_ % – when you have that kind of a number with three people , it’s actually _UNK_ of .
and all throughout , it was 17 people , then 15 , then 12 , you know , it’s tremendous , and we were getting very high numbers .
and some of the numbers in my opinion that i got in the early stages were in a state with _UNK_ % but there were 14 people .
i think that might actually be more and better than getting _UNK_ % in new york .
but we never got the credit for that .
but now we don’t need the credit because we’re going after hillary clinton .
she will not be a great president .
she will not be a good president .
she will be a poor president .
she doesn’t understand trade .
her husband signed perhaps in the history of the world the single worst trade deal ever done .
it’s called _UNK_ .
and i was witnessed to the carnage over the last six weeks especially .
now i’ve known _UNK_ and i’ve known _UNK_ and i’ve known all of the different places that i visited in new york and then pennsylvania and then maryland , which treated me so great the people are incredible .
and all of the different state – connecticut .
and i’ve witnessed what it’s done really firsthand .
and it has been indeed carnage .
and we’re going to change it around .
we’re not going to let carrier and all of these companies just think they can move – go to another country , make their products , sell it back to us , and we get only one thing : we get unemployment .
not going to happen anymore , folks .
not going to happen anymore .
we’re going to bring back our jobs and we’re going to keep our jobs .
we’re not going to let companies leave .
now , if they want to go to a different state , good luck , compete .
but when they start going to different countries and in many cases countries that _UNK_ their currency and make it impossible for our companies to compete , that’s not going to happen .
not going to happen .
and if they want to do it anyway , there will be consequences , and there will be very , very serious consequences .
i have to tell you that i’ve _UNK_ all my life .
competitive person .
all my life i’ve been in _UNK_ .
different _UNK_ whether it’s sports or business or now for 10 months politics .
and i have to tell you that i have met some of the most incredible competitors that i have ever _UNK_ against right here on the republican party .
you know , we started off with that 17 number .
and just so you understand – ted cruz – i don’t know if he likes me or if he doesn’t like me .
but he is one hell of a _UNK_ .
he is a tough , smart guy .
and he has got an amazing future .
he’s got an amazing future .
so i want to congratulate ted .
and i know how tough it is .
it’s tough .
it’s tough .
i’ve had some moments where it’s not looking so good , and it’s not a great feeling .
and so i understand how ted feels and _UNK_ and their whole beautiful family .
and i just want to say that one tough _UNK_ and i can say that for the others .
i mean , chris _UNK_ who _UNK_ me .
incredible guy .
dr. ben _UNK_ who was right up there , one of the first .
he just called me and said , `` it’s a movement you’ve got going .
we’ve got to do something because i’ll tell you what , it’s an incredible movement . ''
and dr. ben _UNK_ _UNK_ me .
and i want to tell you that is an incredible man and we want to keep ben _UNK_ involved because we’re going to win .
we’re going to win in november .
and we’re going to win big and it’s going to be america first .
you know , i made a speech the other day and i talked about how we’re the _UNK_ for the world , how we protect other countries and they don’t respect us and they don’t take care of us and they don’t treat us right in many cases .
and that’s not going to happen .
now , we’re going to keep things going and we’re going to keep things going very _UNK_ but we owe – soon – $ _UNK_ trillion .
it’s $ 19 trillion now but with a budget that was recently done , soon it will be $ _UNK_ trillion .
and we’re just not in a position that we’re in 30 years ago , 40 years ago , 50 years ago when a lot of these things took place and began taking place .
so , we’re going to have _UNK_ good relationships with other countries .
but likewise they have to treat us fairly and they have to understand that what we’ve been doing over the years has been so wrong and so unfair to the united states , to its people , and to its taxpayers .
so that will change .
and i will tell you , they’re going to end up _UNK_ us better than they do right .
they’re going to respect us .
in this building right _UNK_ , i have the largest bank in the world from china .
the relationship is _UNK_ .
we have great relationships with many foreign countries .
but they have to respect us and they have to understand where we’re coming from .
and you know , it is a _UNK_ street .
and the _UNK_ street means that we’re going down one side and they’re coming up the other .
and we’re going to meet and we are going to have something that’s going to be really _UNK_ .
now , if that can’t happen .
if for some reason they want this system to continue the way it’s going now , which is not fair and not good , where we’re spending trillions and trillions of dollars probably $ 4 trillion in the middle east .
and we have to build our infrastructure , our roads .
we have to rebuild our bridges , our airports , our hospitals in this country .
we’ve become close to a third world country .
you look at some of our airports ; it’s third world .
and then you go to other countries and you see places like you’ve never seen .
so i have to say that we are going to turn it around .
we’re going to build up our military bigger , better , stronger than ever before .
it’s the cheapest thing we can do .
and we’re going to have to take out isis and we’re going to have to take them out fast .
we can’t allow that cancer to continue .
we can not allow it to continue .
and you know , one group that’s been so incredible to me are the vets – the veterans .
and they’ve been treated so badly .
so badly .
and we’re going to get that _UNK_ out .
now , one of the things that just happened , which to me is very exciting and it’s happened now with two or three .
but the _UNK_ poll came out yesterday and in that poll , i’m now leading hillary clinton .
a lot of good things ... and that’s going to continue because they’re not going to be able to do it , folks .
they’re not going to be able to make great trade deals .
we have such bad deals .
they’re not going to be able to do what we do with the military .
they’re not going to be able to do what we’re going to do on the border , including the wall .
we’re going to have _UNK_ great relationships with the _UNK_ .
the _UNK_ have been so incredible to me .
they want jobs .
everybody want jobs .
the african-americans want jobs .
you look at what’s going on .
they want jobs .
and we’re going to bring back our jobs .
we’re going to save our jobs and people are going to have great jobs again .
and this country , which is very , very divided in so many different ways is going to become one beautiful loving country .
and we’re going to love each other .
we’re going to cherish each other .
we’re going to take care of each other .
and we’re going to have great economic development .
and we’re not going to let other countries take it away from us because that’s what’s been happening for far too many years and we’re not going to do it anymore .
we’re not going to do it anymore .
i want to thank and congratulate the republican national committee and _UNK_ _UNK_ , who i just spoke to .
he’s doing a tremendous job .
it’s not an easy job when he had 17 _UNK_ and now i guess he’s down to one .
i don’t know .
is there a second ?
i mean , is there a second ?
i don’t know .
but i have ask you folks to explain the status of that .
but he’s done an amazing job and i think we’re going to see something really , really _UNK_ .
i also want to thank my staff , paul , cory , pope .
i mean , these people .
what we’ve been doing has been incredible .
the work has been _UNK_ .
and _UNK_ [ _UNK_ ] , married to my daughter _UNK_ .
i mean , honestly , you know _UNK_ is a very successful real _UNK_ person but i actually think he likes politics more than he likes real _UNK_ .
i’m excited .
and he’s very good at politics .
so again folks this has been an amazing evening .
i didn’t expect this .
i didn’t expect it .
and what ted did is really a very brave thing to do and a great thing to do because we want to bring unity to the republican party .
we have to bring unity .
it’s so much easier if we have it .
and many , many people are calling that you wouldn’t even believe – the media , the press , they wouldn’t believe .
people who have said the worst things about me – i’ve never had things said about me like this .
you know , with my businesses , i’ve always been very respected .
people didn’t talk to me this way .
but in politics , it’s easy .
the worst things and they’re calling now and they’re calling us all and they’re saying , `` we’d love to get on the train '' – the `` trump train '' they call it – `` but we’d love to get on the team . ''
and i actually spoke to one today who was vicious .
i mean , this guy was _UNK_ .
and i said , `` i’d love having you and i think it’s terrific .
but after what you said about me how can you possibly join our team ? ''
and he said , `` mr. trump , don’t even think about it .
don’t worry about it .
_UNK_ be no problem . ''
in other words , he’s a politician ; there’s no problem .
i would have had a hard time .
but we have a lot of people coming – _UNK_ of congressmen .
i have to thank jeff _UNK_ – _UNK_ jeff _UNK_ – one of the most respected men or people in congress .
and so many others .
i mean , _UNK_ _UNK_ has been from day one incredible .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , jr. liberty university , i mean he is something .
he is really a special person .
they’ve done an incredible job and everybody goes through liberty .
we all go through liberty and somehow he liked what i was saying and perhaps he liked the way i said it .
but he’s a special guy and he really has helped .
and so many pastors and ministers .
and tonight , i see that i won with the _UNK_ .
the _UNK_ vote was for trump .
and there’s no greater honor .
no greater honor .
we’re going to work together for many , many years .
we’re going to make it so good .
we’re going to be saying _UNK_ christmas again .
we’re going to be saying it ... and i won with women .
i love winning with women .
but i won with women .
i won with men .
we won with _UNK_ .
we won with african-americans .
we won with every – virtually every category .
so it’s just been an amazing evening .
so again , i want to congratulate ted cruz .
he is a tough , smart _UNK_ .
i want to thank my wife and my family .
it’s an incredible family .
i want to thank my staff – both my staff and my thousands and thousands of people that work for the trump organization , and perhaps in all fairness more importantly on this evening and for what we’re doing currently , my staff where we’re running for the presidency .
and remember this .
our _UNK_ is very simple .
it’s make america great .
we will make america great again .
we will start winning again .
you will be so proud of this country very , very soon .
thank you all .
thank you very much .
thank you !
thank you very much !
so beautiful .
she said , `` do you mind ?
i wrote something – coming out , i wrote something .
do you mind if i said it ? ''
i said , `` not at all .
should i read it ? ''
she said , `` i don’t want you to read it .
i don’t want you to read it . ''
thank you very much .
i want to thank _UNK_ for that .
that was very special .
you know , _UNK_ a really special place , and we’ve been all over today .
speeches all over .
we had one before .
thousands and thousands of people standing outside of an _UNK_ _UNK_ because the _UNK_ was _UNK_ .
and we had another one in the morning , and it’s been an amazing day , and some _UNK_ results .
you see what’s happening with the polls .
boom !
like a rocket ship .
it’s like a rocket .
i guess i just heard when i walked in one just came out that we’re 10 points up .
but don’t worry about that .
pretend you didn’t hear that .
go out and vote tomorrow .
okay ?
go out and vote tomorrow .
you know , i always tell – i used to say this to politicians that run _UNK_ be friends of mine , i’d say , `` pretend you’re a little bit behind .
okay ?
that way you’d work hard .
you’d never forget . ''
but you know , there’s somebody that was – i saw just a little while ago in the audience a very special woman , an incredible woman , and _UNK_ just said hello and met her was so taken , and she represented you so _UNK_ .
and some of you know who she is .
many of you know who she is .
but she was miss wisconsin .
she has one of the most incredible _UNK_ that i’ve ever seen .
she’s got her husband and her son and her son is absolutely magnificent and she loves him more than anything that you can imagine .
i’ll tell you that’s an amazing and just an incredible story and we’re going to make sure that it goes as well as it can .
she was so amazing the way she walked up here and just spoke from the heart , and we all have to speak from the heart .
and you noticed no _UNK_ ?
we don’t have _UNK_ .
we want to do it right from here and from here and from here .
but i just want to – i saw _UNK_ , and i said , `` i have to have you up '' because her _UNK_ an amazing story and it’s a story of courage and we’re going to work with her family and we’re going to make sure everything goes well .
okay , thank you all very much .
so , in coming over today and in going through a few of them , i said to a few of the folks i’ve got to explain what’s happening because our country is being _UNK_ by _UNK_ , by bad deals , by _UNK_ _UNK_ , by _UNK_ , which cruz wants badly and which is going to destroy wisconsin .
this trans-pacific partnership is a disaster .
cruz is pushing it hard .
_UNK_ , i don’t think he’s a _UNK_ here .
i mean , the guy is one in _UNK_ he’s one and it was in his own state .
and if i would have campaigned there two more days instead of staying in florida , i would have won in my opinion ohio .
he’s one and _UNK_ now , in all fairness , _UNK_ bush was doing a lot better than that .
many people were doing better .
it’s called you get out .
he’s taking my votes .
we have to get over 50 % .
and how do you do that ?
look , at a certain point in life , what you do is you say , `` i’m one in _UNK_ in other words , i’ve won one out of _UNK_ states , '' and you do what _UNK_ did , which was great , and you do what _UNK_ paul did , and you do what a lot of them did , and you get out .
and she’s going through a very hard time .
and she has been so supportive and so like just incredible of what we’re all – what we’re trying to do .
not me .
i’m a _UNK_ .
what we’re trying to do – make america great again and bring it back and stop letting the world take advantage of us both _UNK_ and we don’t win anymore .
we don’t win anymore .
we don’t win with trade .
we don’t win with the military .
we pay for everybody else’s military .
we don’t know what we’re doing .
and she saw it and she was here early .
and she knows that we’re going to take care of our people , and it’s going to be america first .
it’s got to be america first .
we have no choice .
we have no choice .
and she’s with a friend of _UNK_ who’s very _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ , who is a tremendous , tremendous woman and just an amazing person .
also a great _UNK_ but i won’t even mention that because _UNK_ would be the last to want to have people know that .
_UNK_ is such a great friend of _UNK_ young and _UNK_ young – i just want to bring her and _UNK_ onto the stage and maybe _UNK_ would like to say something and _UNK_ .
but this is just an _UNK_ woman .
so could i ask _UNK_ to come up on stage please ?
and by the way , if you want , you could put your name up and you say `` i want to run '' and you go to the convention and you run .
but it would be nice to see – because i’ll tell you what , he takes my votes away much more than he does cruz .
and i don’t like it .
i don’t think it’s right .
i don’t think it’s appropriate .
but you know what ?
if we have to live with him , we still beat him easily .
okay , folks ?
i mean , okay ?
but _UNK_ voted for _UNK_ .
_UNK_ was a disaster for wisconsin and it was a disaster for our country .
ted cruz wants _UNK_ and it is going to make _UNK_ look like _UNK_ .
what they’re doing to us with those documents , and cruz is the one that insisted that we can’t talk about money _UNK_ , which is _UNK_ of _UNK_ in the agreement .
he wouldn’t let them do it .
he’s the one that fought currency _UNK_ .
that’s the single biggest tool that other countries have for taking our business , taking our money , and taking our jobs .
and we can’t let this go on any longer .
now , they’re controlled by their _UNK_ .
they’re controlled by the people that put up their campaign contributions .
they’re controlled , you know , with the lobbyists in washington .
they have signs on their _UNK_ .
it’s like stamped into their _UNK_ – `` i take care of cruz . ''
they’re _UNK_ .
`` i take care of _UNK_ . ''
`` i take care of hillary . ''
oh , hillary .
_UNK_ .
`` take care of hillary . ''
so we can’t let it happen anymore .
we can’t let it happen anymore .
it’s time – you know obama used to say , `` time for change '' ?
i’ll say it’s time for change but real change this time not that change .
real change .
obama yesterday – president obama yesterday for the first time he started having _UNK_ about the iran deal .
i could have told him that six months ago , nine months ago , long before it was signed .
the _UNK_ isn’t even dry and now he’s finally starting to understand it was a big beautiful mistake and it’s only going to get worse .
and by the way , iran is getting worse .
they were supposed to come into the community .
remember ?
what a bunch of _UNK_ .
are we _UNK_ ?
are we _UNK_ ?
hello over there .
they were supposed to come into the community and they were supposed to , you know , get involved .
now , you see they just ordered _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
those are the big _UNK_ .
_UNK_ they didn’t order _UNK_ .
the reason – one of the reasons is we restrict them from spending .
so we give them $ 150 billion and they’re not even allowed to give us money by investing , by buying our products .
okay ?
how _UNK_ are we ?
how much longer is it going to last ?
when are we going to get smart ?
when are we going to stop ?
we as a country are being ripped off .
we are being ripped off by virtually every single country in the world .
okay ?
whether it’s _UNK_ or trade .
we don’t win anymore .
we can’t win with the military .
we can’t beat isis .
can you imagine _UNK_ _UNK_ or _UNK_ george patton ?
they say get rid of isis .
what do you think ?
... it’s so _UNK_ to see what’s happening to our country and we’re going to turn it around and we’re going to change it .
and we’re going to make it rich again , and we’re going to make it strong again .
so , and so many different elements , and i’ve been talking about trade .
i always talk about trade .
because when i announced on june _UNK_ coming down the _UNK_ with _UNK_ , it was like the academy _UNK_ .
there were so many cameras ; i’ve never seen anything like it .
so many cameras .
and i took a deep _UNK_ and i said , `` let’s go . ''
because we have to do it .
you know , it takes _UNK_ .
running for president , believe me , takes _UNK_ .
it takes a lot of _UNK_ .
believe me .
and even for the politicians they run at least they’re out on the line , and then you see the _UNK_ .
you see where i won louisiana and then i find out that i’m not supposed to get as many delegates as the person that i beat .
what kind of stuff is that ?
and somebody said , `` well , there’s a rule and another rule . ''
i don’t care about rules , folks .
i go out and i campaign .
we win .
we win .
we get the delegates .
right ?
but in the meantime , we have millions more votes than cruz .
we’ve beaten him in most of the states .
i mean , we’re just winning so much .
and we’re winning by almost 300 delegates .
so we’re doing great .
and i think we close it out before the convention .
i think we actually close it out before the convention .
and that’s like a _UNK_ .
you know , they go into _UNK_ territory , and the _UNK_ , he goes in .
and they say , `` what do you think ?
you may have an _UNK_ decision . ''
he says , `` no , when you knock them out , there’s no _UNK_ decision . ''
if we get the delegates , we’ve pulled out a _UNK_ .
and that’s the way it’s going to be , and i can see that happening because more and more people are calling , they want to get on board .
frankly , when i looked at what happened – a friend of mine , who’s a great – you know , one of my great friends , he lives right down – not very far from here .
and he said , `` with wisconsin , you’re going win . ''
i said , `` well , what do you think ?
but i’m not seeing polls that are great .
i’m a little bit down .
i’m down in some .
i’m a little bit down . ''
he says , `` no , no , you’re going to win .
but you have to be there .
you have to come in and you have to talk to the people . ''
like we did this afternoon at the _UNK_ .
and he said , `` you’re going to win .
i mean , you’re going to win . ''
he’s a very smart guy , i want to tell you .
great guy .
but he said , `` you’ve got to come in . ''
we’ve been making – i’ve been making speeches , three today , four yesterday , three or four the other day .
we’re here constantly .
you’re going to get so sick of me .
you’re going to say , `` oh , get him the hell out of here . ''
no , we are making so much progress and it’s been so inspiring to see the people .
i mean , look at even you people .
you don’t sit down .
if you want , you can .
oh , stay up .
stand up .
what the _UNK_ ?
hey , we’ve got plenty of time to sit down , right ?
we’ve got plenty of time .
but i do appreciate that .
that’s a sign of _UNK_ , and it’s a sign of respect , and i really do appreciate it .
that’s really nice .
so we have to bring our country back and so many different things .
with china , we have a trade deficit of $ 500 billion a year .
with mexico , we will build a wall .
we will have strong borders .
strong borders .
believe me .
we have a trade deficit of $ _UNK_ billion a year .
the _UNK_ going to cost $ 10 billion to build .
and people , the politicians are saying , `` how can you possibly get them to pay ? ''
let me tell you something , folks .
we have some good business people in this audience .
when you have a $ _UNK_ billion deficit , and you have a $ 10 billion wall , that’s real easy .
and that’s on a _UNK_ basis the $ _UNK_ billion .
it’s really easy .
and they don’t understand it .
they said , `` how are you going to get them to pay ? ''
i said , `` it’s so easy . ''
and you understand it .
just rely on me .
okay ?
rely .
so easy .
that’s so easy .
and we’re going to have a strong border .
you know , two days ago i was greatly honored because the border patrol , the folks that do a great job , and they’re told to stand back but they don’t want to stand back .
they want to do their job properly .
they’re proud people .
they’re incredible people .
frankly , before the wall goes up , we might not even need the wall , but we’re building it anyway .
okay ?
we’re building it .
believe me .
but the border patrol people are _UNK_ people , and its _UNK_ people gave me an _UNK_ two days ago .
and i didn’t ask for it .
i didn’t know .
first time , first time they’ve ever done it .
right ?
first time , they’ve ever done it and they gave me an _UNK_ .
and it’s so important .
now , _UNK_ joe [ _UNK_ ] from arizona .
you know , i won arizona very big , and _UNK_ joe was with me and it was incredible and we love it .
look , we have to have strong borders .
we can’t let the _UNK_ come in that we have no idea who they are , where they’re coming from .
we don’t know if they’re _UNK_ .
this could be the _UNK_ great _UNK_ horse .
who knows ?
i have as big a heart as anybody .
we want to help them .
we want to build safe _UNK_ in syria .
i want to get the gulf states to pay for it .
the gulf states have nothing but money .
we don’t have money .
we will run it .
we will do a good job .
we’ll get it done but let somebody else pay for it for a change .
we can’t do it .
... i keep getting these _UNK_ .
you know , al green – the great al green wrote `` the _UNK_ '' .
how many people have heard `` the _UNK_ '' ?
how many people ?
oh , do you want to hear `` the _UNK_ '' ?
do you want to hear it ?
i mean , people love it and i love it because it says what’s going to happen to us if we’re not careful .
and this really _UNK_ to allowing people into our country that we know are going – we’re going to have problems .
we’re going to have huge problems .
allowing people in from areas of the world we don’t know where they come from .
we don’t know where their documents are .
they say they don’t have documents .
they have no papers .
no nothing .
we let them in .
how _UNK_ can we be ?
so this is called `` the _UNK_ '' and i think it’s pretty good .
all right ?
are you ready for this ?
a couple of you have heard it but some of you haven’t .
`` on her way to work one morning , down the path along the _UNK_ , a _UNK_ woman saw a poor _UNK_ _UNK_ .
his pretty _UNK_ skin had been all _UNK_ with the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ well , _UNK_ she _UNK_ , _UNK_ take you in , and i’ll take care of _UNK_ _UNK_ me in , oh _UNK_ woman .
take me in for _UNK_ sake .
take me in , oh _UNK_ woman , _UNK_ _UNK_ the broken _UNK_ .
she _UNK_ him up all _UNK_ in a _UNK_ of _UNK_ and then laid him by the _UNK_ with some _UNK_ and some _UNK_ .
now she _UNK_ home from work that night .
as soon as she arrived , she found that pretty _UNK_ she’d taken in had been _UNK_ .
_UNK_ me in , oh _UNK_ woman .
take me in for _UNK_ sake .
take me in , oh _UNK_ woman , _UNK_ _UNK_ the broken _UNK_ .
now she _UNK_ him to her _UNK_ .
_UNK_ so beautiful , _UNK_ she _UNK_ .
_UNK_ if i hadn’t brought you in by now , _UNK_ sake you might have _UNK_ now she _UNK_ his pretty skin and then she _UNK_ him and held him tight .
but instead of saying thank you , that _UNK_ gave her a vicious bite .
_UNK_ me in , oh _UNK_ woman .
take me in for _UNK_ sake .
take me in , oh _UNK_ woman , _UNK_ _UNK_ the very , very healthy _UNK_ .
_UNK_ saved you , _UNK_ _UNK_ the woman , _UNK_ you bit me .
_UNK_ why ?
you know your bite is _UNK_ and now i’m going to _UNK_ _UNK_ shut up , _UNK_ woman , _UNK_ said the _UNK_ with a _UNK_ .
_UNK_ knew _UNK_ well i was a _UNK_ before you took me _UNK_ '' right ?
that’s what’s happening to our country , folks .
that’s what’s happening to our country and we can’t let it happen .
we have to be smart .
we have to be vigilant .
we have to be strong .
and if we’re not , we’re not going to have a country .
and we need borders and we’re going to have borders .
and we need great trade deals and we’re going to make great trade deals .
and we can’t let mexico and i have great respect for mexico and i respect their leaders but we can’t let mexico and china and any country you want to name steal our business , steal our jobs .
when you look at what’s happening in wisconsin – and you see it – the reason i beat your governor and i beat him badly was i just read off the statistics .
i just read – all i did , i stood up and i read statistics .
you’re losing jobs ... it’s very average .
it’s very average .
our country is less than average .
okay ?
our country is doing so badly .
and it’s just one of those things and we have to _UNK_ up and we have to get really tough .
we have to get so , so , so vigilant and not be so politically correct .
we have to do what’s right for our country .
when the great ford _UNK_ company – great company – when they build a $ 2.5 billion plant in mexico , when _UNK_ moves its massive plant to mexico from chicago , we can’t let it happen .
when carrier air _UNK_ , as you know , they just announced they’re moving to mexico .
_UNK_ is moving to ireland .
but let me just tell you .
so , i watched the politicians and they have no business _UNK_ .
but more importantly , they’re taken care of .
you know , a lot of friends come up to me and they say , `` donald , let me ask you a question .
these politicians – are they really that dumb ? ''
i said , `` no , they’re not actually that dumb .
some are .
but they’re not actually that dumb .
they’re all taken care of by the special interests .
and when you want something done , you see certain people in washington . ''
hey , who is better than me ?
i mean , take a look at me .
i was before june _UNK_ , i was a part of the _UNK_ and they will do not what’s right for you but they will do what’s right for the company they represent or the country they represent and the united states continues to get ripped off , ripped off , ripped off .
and a lot of times , i’ll say , `` how can a deal be so _UNK_ made ?
these people are so _UNK_ . ''
they’re not _UNK_ .
they’re doing it for themselves .
they’re doing it because they want campaign contributions .
they’re doing it because they want money put in their _UNK_ .
they are _UNK_ controlled by the money .
believe me .
they are _UNK_ controlled by the money , and that’s not good for our country .
okay ?
that’s not good because terrible things are happening and we’re getting weaker and weaker .
hundreds of thousands and even millions of jobs are being taken out .
you look at the jobs we have .
even in wisconsin , i mean , you see the jobs , the manufacturing , it’s all so down and so _UNK_ and throughout the united states .
and it’s a disaster what’s going on in our country .
we’re not going to have jobs left .
and they do it with _UNK_ of currency .
and they do it with _UNK_ .
they do it with so many different elements that our people don’t even know what’s happening .
our politicians in most cases don’t even know what’s happening .
and when they do know what’s happening and they let it happen , it’s even worse .
so i’m not taking money from anybody .
i’m _UNK_ my campaign .
and we’re going to get it .
we’re going to get it .
now , i look at this u.s. manufacturing – i mean , just look at this .
look at these _UNK_ .
i mean , you can see them ... this is where we’re going .
you know that’s not good .
right ?
this is where we’re going .
there was one that i just saw .
just got this .
it’s like incredible .
look at this .
this is u.s. manufacturing jobs rapidly decline since year _UNK_ look at that chart .
another couple of years , there won’t be any jobs .
and the jobs we have now are bad jobs .
these are bad jobs .
these aren’t good jobs .
and everybody _UNK_ that .
even the other side says , `` we agree .
they’re bad jobs . ''
and the number that they talk about when they say 5 % unemployment – it’s a _UNK_ number .
when you stop looking for a job , you’re considered _UNK_ _UNK_ .
it was a number that was made up years ago probably by president but certainly by politicians to make them look good , to make them look really good like the economy .
the economy is not good .
the economy is bad .
we’re sitting on a bubble .
the banks have money .
they give it to you for nothing if you’re rich .
if you’re not rich , that’s when you need the money , they don’t loan it to you .
so the people can’t do jobs .
probably here you have some great companies , some really good smaller companies , you can’t get the banks to give you money .
the banks are controlled by the regulators .
they system that this country is run under is out of control .
and we’re going to change it .
we’re going to bring back the jobs .
we’re going to bring back our companies .
and you know i’ve had such a response .
and the reason i’ve had response is because of that and then i look at the ads today .
i’m in _UNK_ and i look at the ads and cruz makes up these ads .
`` we’re going to bring back jobs '' – he’s using my same language .
here’s the problem .
they don’t know where to begin .
they don’t know where to begin .
and if they did , _UNK_ ted , _UNK_ , he comes up .
did you ever see a guy like this ?
just look what he did with ben _UNK_ .
ben _UNK_ , who _UNK_ me by the way , is a great guy , and _UNK_ ted , remember in iowa , he said `` ben has left the race .
he’s left the race . ''
this was on election day .
it’s not like two days before or the day after .
`` during the election , he left the race . ''
okay ?
and people believed him and thousands of votes were cast not for ben but for ted cruz .
it’s _UNK_ _UNK_ .
it’s lying .
and then there were many other things .
and actually during one of the debates , _UNK_ _UNK_ looked over and he said , `` you’re a _UNK_ . ''
and i said , `` you know , i never heard a politician call another politician _UNK_ so we can do it . ''
so we now call him _UNK_ ted – _UNK_ .
it’s _UNK_ .
it’s _UNK_ .
i mean , what he does and what he says is just terrible .
and you know , i’ve met a lot tougher people but i’ve never met any human that _UNK_ as much as him .
and he comes in and you noticed the tremendous _UNK_ support i have ?
i have _UNK_ _UNK_ jr. from liberty university .
i have all of these people .
i have such incredible support .
and the _UNK_ – he thought he was going to get the _UNK_ but they don’t like _UNK_ and they see he lies so much .
do you ever see him – he walks up and he walks in with the _UNK_ , held high .
right ?
held high and then he starts to lie .
boy , he is bad .
so _UNK_ , i don’t think that you’re going to fall for that .
i really don’t think that anybody is going to fall – he doesn’t talk .
he debates ... i said , `` ted , take it easy .
just talk .
talk .
talk . ''
but we’re doing really well .
the whole thing is just working out .
and i loved being here .
you know , i’ve been here for a long time .
i’ve been here for a long time .
i’m going here – we’re going to stay tomorrow .
we’re going to have some , i think i’m doing fox and friends tomorrow morning .
i’m doing some shows tomorrow .
we’re going to do some shows and we’re going to be around and we’re going to make sure – we want to bring this home .
if we can – you know , we have a movement going on , folks .
and it’s a movement of intelligence , actually .
it’s a movement of common sense .
that’s all it is .
we’re not going to let carrier make air _UNK_ , fire all of its people , move to mexico , make the air _UNK_ then come in and take the money out of the country .
it’s not going to happen anymore .
and i’m a free _UNK_ .
and they say , `` he’s not a – `` remember _UNK_ bush ?
`` he is not a conservative . ''
i said , `` what ? ''
i am a conservative .
but you know what ?
i believe in free trade .
but when you have free trade , you need smart people running your side of the free trade .
if you don’t have smart people or if you have people like ted cruz that are _UNK_ controlled by the people that give him the money and they’re controlled by the _UNK_ .
i mean , look at the _UNK_ .
this guy in his whole life didn’t know what the word _UNK_ meant .
now you have all these people going because they said , `` oh man , trump is terrible .
he doesn’t want any of our money . ''
i had one friend that came into my office – i don’t think i’ve ever said this before .
he came into my office .
he wanted to give me millions of dollars .
i said , `` i can’t take your money .
i don’t want your money .
i’m _UNK_ . ''
he said , `` no , no , no , you’ve got to be _UNK_ . ''
he didn’t even know .
he thought i was _UNK_ .
he wanted to _UNK_ me , wanted to support me .
i said no , no , i don’t want .
anyway , he was finally convinced that i didn’t want his money and he’s leaving .
and i said , `` by the way , what are you going to do now ? ''
he said , `` i’m going to give it to another candidate . ''
and i said , `` why ? ''
they’re _UNK_ .
they have to do it .
it’s like almost a disease .
they have to do it .
it’s the _UNK_ thing .
he loves me .
he wants to give give me probably close to $ 10 million .
right ?
i would have had the greatest _UNK_ _UNK_ in the history if i would have taken all the money .
and my whole life , you know , i’ve said this before , my whole life as a business person is this .
right ?
it’s okay .
nothing wrong with it .
i take .
i keep taking .
i take and take .
but now i’m going to take for the united states .
we’re going to take .
we’re not going to be the _UNK_ people anymore .
we’re not going to be the _UNK_ people anymore .
we can’t be .
we can’t be .
and with nato when they don’t pay , you know , i said – i was asked a question by _UNK_ _UNK_ , a very fair question about nato .
now , you know , i’ve been a _UNK_ .
world class .
i _UNK_ my business papers .
they were _UNK_ .
everybody says great , great , great .
i built a great company .
very little debt .
tremendous cash flow .
some of the greatest assets in the world .
and i tell you that only for one reason – that’s the thinking we need in washington .
we need some of that thinking .
and _UNK_ _UNK_ asked me a question on television .
he said , `` let me just ask you about nato . ''
now , i haven’t been asked about nato a lot but i understand nato and i understand common sense , and i’m like a smart person like many of the people in this room .
hopefully all of the people in this room .
but he asked me about nato .
i said , `` it’s _UNK_ . ''
this was my first thing .
and you know what ?
i’m the first one .
guys that study nato and good people but they study nato and they say , `` i don’t believe it .
what he just said , i never thought of it . ''
they study it because they’re so into it that they don’t realize because it was really put there .
you had the soviet union and now you have russia , which is different but russia is powerful so we could sort of say that’s a balance .
so we’ll leave it .
but it doesn’t really cover terrorism like it’s supposed to .
doesn’t have the right countries .
i mean , many of the countries and there aren’t – that you associate with terrorism .
and so i said number one , it’s _UNK_ .
i said number two , to the best of my knowledge , the united states pay far too much _UNK_ and why are we always paying the bills to protect other people ?
and the press , which is so _UNK_ _UNK_ , the press goes – headlines the next day – `` trump doesn’t want nato , wants to _UNK_ nato '' .
and that’s not what i said .
i said , you’ve got to pay your bills .
and you know what ?
if you can’t pay your bills , honestly , there should be – they’ve got to go because we can’t do it .
you know , this isn’t _UNK_ years ago .
this isn’t when it was originally formed like many , many years ago , many decades ago , and you have to _UNK_ things .
but it is interesting .
some of the _UNK_ people have said `` what trump said is genius .
it’s _UNK_ .
and you know what ?
it’s true . ''
there’s a lot of people , a lot of countries being given a free ride .
we can’t have the free rides any more , folks .
... thank you .
well , we need somebody with that ... and it’s america first , folks .
it’s america first .
so then , as you know , north korea is a big problem .
north korea is a problem .
a problem that could be solved easily by china but they don’t want to solve it because they want to _UNK_ us .
they’re building in the south china _UNK_ a massive military fort .
you know what’s going on .
they shouldn’t be doing that .
and they’re taking our money and , you know , you talk about the _UNK_ of trade , you talk about the kind of money .
how about this ?
we owe china $ _UNK_ trillion .
now , they take our money .
they take our jobs ... i’m not angry at china .
i’m angry at our people and our leaders for letting it happen .
i’m not angry with china .
if you can get away with it , you do it .
but they take our jobs , they take our money , they take our money .
they take everything .
we owe them $ _UNK_ trillion .
that’s sort of like a magic act .
doesn’t it ?
amazing .
japan , they send cars by the millions .
they come off those boats .
los _UNK_ – i was there at the _UNK_ .
i looked at the biggest boats you’ve ever seen .
biggest , greatest ships you’ve ever seen .
the cars are _UNK_ off the ships .
we owe them $ 1.5 trillion .
it’s like , well , how does this all happen ?
okay ?
how does it happen ?
here’s the story , folks .
we’re going to change our thinking .
we’re going to be the smart people again .
we’re going to be so smart .
we’re going to be so sharp .
so a lot of people don’t know we protect japan .
do you know that ?
does anybody know ?
you might know ... we protect japan .
we protect germany .
we protect south korea .
when you want a television set , who do you get it from ?
south korea .
_UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
you get it from south korea .
so we protect all and big ships they make .
these are _UNK_ , _UNK_ economies .
we protect them .
they don’t pay what they should be paying for not having to have this massive military _UNK_ that we supply .
and you know what ?
we get that because we have people that don’t know what they’re doing in washington for many years .
i mean , i’m not even blaming it – _UNK_ the worst .
he’s the worst .
the worst .
i mean , when he just _UNK_ , i mean he just realized that the iran deal is a bad deal .
it just took him – realize – i said , `` oh , why didn’t you listen to me two years ago ? ''
just two years ago if he would have listened – can you imagine ?
did you ever see a deal take so long ?
by the way , usually when a deal takes that long , it’s bad automatically .
i can usually tell you that .
but anyway , so we protect japan .
so it comes out ... i said , look , i would have to tell japan and i’m talking about other nations also because i have great friends from japan , i have great friends from south korea .
we have to go see them , go to talk to , have a meeting with them , `` we love protecting you . ''
we don’t want them to arm necessarily .
but you know , at some point , how long are we going to do this ?
so we have to see them and we have to say , `` you’ve got to help us out . ''
you know , we have this massive , massive amount of money that we have to get rid of because we’re sitting on one of the worst bubbles you’ll ever see .
okay ?
believe me .
we’ve got to _UNK_ it out .
we’ve got to _UNK_ out our trade deals .
we’ve got to _UNK_ out our military deals .
we’re taking care of all these countries .
so we go to japan .
and here’s what the ... i was telling the people and they said `` _UNK_ , that sounds good . ''
we’ve got to take – you’ve got to take care of us .
now , they’ll probably say initially `` no '' .
and then we leave and then they’re going to say , `` yes . ''
but if they don’t say yes , you always have to be prepared to make a great deal to walk .
you have to be ... the problem with the iran deal was that secretary kerry was like an _UNK_ .
call him _UNK_ night .
he refused to walk .
they were _UNK_ at him in the streets of iran .
they were claiming the deal was the greatest deal ever made before it was even made .
they were saying `` this deal is _UNK_ . ''
they were _UNK_ at the secretary of state of this country .
they were _UNK_ at the united states saying that this deal is great .
and they were _UNK_ .
remember ?
burning the flag _UNK_ ?
when they start _UNK_ about a deal that i’m making , when they start burning the american flag , i’m out of there .
_UNK_ _UNK_ .
good luck .
and he just kept going back .
and i kept waiting .
i wanted to call him .
i wanted to call him .
i wanted to say , `` walk . ''
because every single thing – he’d say , `` we would like to get this . ''
`` no ! ''
`` oh , okay .
you’ve got it .
we would like to get that . ''
`` no ! ''
you know , the _UNK_ are great negotiators .
it’s an _UNK_ deal .
but just yesterday , obama just yesterday he brought it up that he’s very _UNK_ .
i mean , think of it .
think of it .
$ 150 billion .
it’s the worst deal .
we didn’t get our prisoners back .
we should have had the prisoners back before we started negotiating .
increase the sanctions .
don’t sit at the table .
say `` you give our prisoners back or we’re not starting . ''
you leave .
they’ll say `` no '' .
you leave .
and what happens ?
you double up the sanctions .
within 24 hours , they call you and they say , `` you’ve got your prisoners . ''
that could have been years ago .
right ?
so we have people that don’t know what they’re doing .
here’s the story .
you need trump .
you do .
you need trump .
you bet ... you do .
i mean , you’ve got to have trump .
i mean , it’s sort of interesting because i see when i turn on the television , i see these ads about myself by _UNK_ people .
i see these ads and they’re mostly wrong .
a little bit sometimes are right but they’re all negative .
you know .
and i’m looking , i’m watching this on television – ad after ad .
in florida , they spent $ _UNK_ million on negative ads and i won it in a _UNK_ ... does anybody read ?
does anybody watch television ?
you know , it’s not much for the _UNK_ community when you think they spent $ _UNK_ million – a record number in florida .
they spent thousands and thousands of ads nationwide – listen to this one – _UNK_ negative ads on me .
most of them was made up .
i’ll give you one good example .
we have the _UNK_ for growth , which is forget them .
these are among the _UNK_ people that you’ll ever meet .
they come to my office .
they want me to give them $ 1 million .
a friend asked me , `` please see them . ''
i said , `` who are they ? ''
`` they’re _UNK_ for growth . ''
whatever that means .
so they come to my office .
they asked me for $ 1 million .
i say , `` no , thank you . ''
and that’s it .
then they write me a letter , which i _UNK_ , asking me for $ 1 million .
i said very _UNK_ – i’m not a bad person – i said _UNK_ `` no , thank you . ''
i mean , you can be rich but you don’t have to be _UNK_ .
okay ?
why am i going to give them $ 1 million ?
so , what happens is all of a sudden i see their name all over the place – `` _UNK_ for growth '' and they talk about , you know , different things – _UNK_ things .
i mean , they’re the worst ads .
and by the way , once was a _UNK_ ad because they said , `` if cruz and _UNK_ got together and you added the delegates '' – and they showed the delegates .
right ?
and you add them up – and i’m over here with a lot .
and they said – and they add them up and they show a _UNK_ that goes much higher than mine and it’s much lower than mine .
they’re a fraud .
and what we did is we told them to stop that ad and that was a week ago .
and we _UNK_ about it .
and everybody’s talking about it .
and i see it last night again .
they’re _UNK_ .
so here’s what they do .
it’s like a form of _UNK_ , i guess .
right ?
when you think of it .
they come to your office .
they ask for $ 1 million .
you don’t give them $ 1 million .
they go out .
they do negative ads .
these are the people – you know , if these people about trump – they call it like `` no trump '' .
what do they call that thing ?
they call it `` never trump '' .
oh , you need trump so badly though .
i was saying if they would work , if they would have worked so hard , so diligently against president barack hussein obama , they would have beaten him .
they would have had great budgets .
they would have had everything they wanted .
but with him ... i always say , `` obama is the worst _UNK_ i’ve ever seen . ''
you look at the – no , except with the republicans .
he gets everything he wants .
i mean , you look at the _UNK_ budget from three months he got everything he wanted – fund obamacare , bring people into the country that shouldn’t be here .
he got everything he wanted .
so he is the worst _UNK_ worldwide .
we have sergeant [ _UNK_ ] _UNK_ .
right ?
we get _UNK_ , a _UNK_ .
no , no , think of it .
this is a negotiation .
we get _UNK_ .
and they get – what do they get ?
five of their most _UNK_ killers that have been in jail for eight years in _UNK_ , which we’re not closing down by the way .
okay ?
we’re going to run it .
so we get _UNK_ , a _UNK_ , who five or six – probably six – people were killed going out to try and get him back .
he left .
he’s a _UNK_ .
so we get _UNK_ , and that’s what we get .
and they get five people that are right now back on the battlefield or soon to be back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody in sight , including us .
okay ?
we’ve got to stop it .
we’ve got to stop it .
so with japan , i said they got to – maybe we’ve got to walk .
and the next day the headlines – `` trump doesn’t want to defend japan '' , `` trump wants japan to get their _UNK_ '' .
okay , here’s the story , folks .
you have japan .
japan is very concerned with north korea .
you know , number one , i like the way it is now but i want them to pay a lot more money .
they probably will .
but if they don’t , it’s not so bad if they are at heads .
maybe we’re not supposed to get into that fight .
that’s a bad fight .
maybe we’re not supposed to .
okay ?
okay ?
same thing with south korea .
i mean , every time he raises his head and he starts talking , every single time he raises his head , our ships start _UNK_ over , our planes start going over .
we do all sorts of exercise .
what are we get out of this ?
we have _UNK_ soldiers on the line .
so , we have to be taken care of .
now , i’m talking as a person _UNK_ .
okay ?
i’m also talking _UNK_ .
but i’m talking _UNK_ .
we don’t have a country that can do this anymore .
saudi arabia , until the oil went down and now they’re still making a fortune .
but saudi arabia was making $ 1 billion a day .
we protect saudi arabia .
if we weren’t there , saudi arabia wouldn’t be there .
if saudi arabia didn’t have us for years protecting them , they would have been gone a long time ago as saudi arabia .
somebody else would have it , probably maybe iraq because he would have come back .
and by the way , speaking of that , you know , i was against going into iraq .
everyone says , `` oh , trump is going to be very tough . ''
i was against going into iraq from the very beginning , from the very beginning .
and i’m going to build our military bigger , stronger than ever before .
but you know what ?
hopefully , we never have to use it .
_UNK_ going to tell us what to do though .
we have to shape it up because our military is _UNK_ _UNK_ .
but if our politicians would have gone to the beach for the last number of years , many years , we would be much stronger in a sense .
we’d be much stronger because the middle east is a disaster .
you see the great _UNK_ .
it’s a catastrophe .
you see what’s going on in germany .
it’s a total mess .
what she has done .
can you imagine ?
she was person of the year .
i was supposed to be person of the year on time magazine .
she beat me out and she destroyed germany .
can you believe this ?
that’s not good .
i wonder if time magazine had that one to do over again what they’d say .
i think we’ll be in much better shape .
well , they’ve treated me nice .
i’ve been on the cover a lot .
and the reason we’re on the cover a lot is because we have a movement the likes of which people have never seen .
so here’s the story .
here’s the story .
you know , one of the great writers called me up and he said , `` what you’ve done is incredible . ''
i said , `` no , no , i have to win . ''
he said , `` no , no , it makes no difference .
if you win , if you lose , it doesn’t matter .
what you’ve done is down in the history books .
you will be cover for all time .
it’s incredible . ''
i said , `` no , sir .
no , sir .
i have to win .
because if i don’t win , to me , i will consider it a tremendous waste of time and waste of money but a tremendous waste of time . ''
so here’s the story .
here’s the story .
we’re going to take care of our second amendment .
it’s being _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
we’re going to get rid of common core .
we’re going to bring education back _UNK_ .
we’re going to repeal and replace obamacare , which is a total catastrophe .
you’re going to have great health insurance .
we’re going to save your social security .
we’re going to save your medicare .
we are going to save it because we are going to make our country rich again .
we’re going to bring back our jobs .
we’re not going to let our jobs go .
and we’re going to be able to afford – you’ve been paying in it a long time and a lot of these guys want it to be knocked to hell .
it’s not going to happen .
okay ?
remember that .
it’s not going to happen .
we’re going to start winning again , folks .
we don’t win anymore .
we don’t win anymore .
we don’t win with our military .
we can’t beat isis .
we’re going to win .
we’re going to knock the hell out of isis .
we don’t win with our vets .
our vets are being treated worse than illegal immigrants .
our vets are being treated so _UNK_ .
they’re our great people .
and other people – you know , vets have _UNK_ me virtually _UNK_ and a lot of the vets will come up to me and say , `` you know , mr. trump , we follow closely what’s going on .
you’re the only person that ever _UNK_ the vets . ''
right ?
and hillary clinton recently said about the vets that they’re being taken care of just fine .
they’re not being take care of fine .
they’re not being taken care of .
she said they’re being taken care of just fine .
i know the vets .
_UNK_ spent more time with the vets that are running .
and we’re going to take care of our vets .
okay ?
we are going to tear up and make great and very _UNK_ and everybody is going to be happy , including the other side , trade deals .
i have the greatest people in the world for dealing .
we use political _UNK_ that don’t know what they’re doing .
they’re dealing against the _UNK_ people in china , the _UNK_ people in japan , the _UNK_ people from all over the world , and our negotiators are political _UNK_ and we’re not using them anymore .
we’re using the greatest business people in the world and we have them in this country and they’re _UNK_ me , and i know the best ones from the not so great ones .
and we’re going to have great , great trade deals .
we’re going to have a strong border .
we’re going to have a real border .
we’re going to have a wall .
mexico is paying for it .
we’re going to have a wall .
and we’re going to stop bad , bad things from happening in this country .
because if you look at what’s going on and you look at the tremendous crime and you look at the drugs that are _UNK_ across the border , it’s – the drugs are _UNK_ like water .
they’re _UNK_ across .
you know when i won – new hampshire is a special place to me because they were the first victory i had .
and i won new hampshire , and i wasn’t expected to win it ; _UNK_ was expected to win it .
and i won it in _UNK_ .
and i’d go around and i’d see the people of new hampshire , and they tell me , `` mr. trump , our biggest problem is _UNK_ . ''
i said , `` _UNK_ ? ''
it doesn’t make sense .
you know , you look at the beautiful _UNK_ or the _UNK_ or the _UNK_ and the _UNK_ .
i said , `` _UNK_ ? ''
it just doesn’t work .
it’s _UNK_ .
right ?
it doesn’t work .
but it was _UNK_ .
and i said , `` if i get in , we’re going to stop that problem . ''
then i said , `` where does it come from ? ''
they said , `` it comes from the southern border .
they come right in . ''
now , new hampshire _UNK_ it their number one problem .
they have a tremendous problem .
but many other communities , including you , but many other communities have this problem .
we’re going to stop it cold , folks .
we’re going to stop it cold .
and the bottom line is this .
look , we have a big , big day .
and you’re going to look back on this evening and you’re going to say that was one of the great _UNK_ of your life because we love the country .
we love the country .
... i love you too .
thank you .
really do .
i love the people .
i love the people .
you know , they say donald trump – my base is so strong .
they say , `` donald trump can do almost anything . ''
in fact , one person today said `` anything '' .
and they _UNK_ a woman , i saw her last night on television sitting in a _UNK_ room , which was not the most beautiful room i’ve ever been .
it was very clean , and i only want clean .
i don’t care about the room .
i want clean .
but they were sitting there and they said to a woman – a wonderful woman , probably 55 years old , and her friends were there .
and they said , `` what would it take to get you to vote for somebody other than donald trump ? ''
she said , `` don’t play that game .
there’s nothing he can do that would get me to vote against him . ''
and i wanted to go up and i wanted to _UNK_ that television set .
i wanted to – i wish i could find out who she is .
but we have so many people like that .
we’re all like that .
i mean , a big chunk of the country is like that because we’re tired of _UNK_ .
we’re tired of seeing what’s happening to our great country .
so , here’s the deal .
you’re going to go home and you’re going to remember this .
but much more importantly , tomorrow , you get everybody you can and i promise you .
you’re going to be so proud of your country .
you’re going to go out and vote .
you’re going to be so proud of your president .
but forget that .
you’re going to be so proud of this country again .
and you’re going to remember the evening because we’re going to start winning again .
we’re going to win on trade .
we’re going to win with our military .
we’re going to knock out the isis .
we’re going to win .
we are going to win with the military .
we’re going to knock out isis .
we’re going to knock them out .
we’re going to win for our vets because our vets have been treated too badly .
it’s not going to happen anymore .
we’re going to win at the border .
we’re going to win with education .
we’re going to win with our second amendment .
so many people talk to me about the second amendment .
we’re going to win at every single element of what we’re doing .
and every single thing we’re going to win , win , win .
and you’re going to say , `` that was the single greatest vote that i have ever cast '' , and you’re going to look back and you’re going to be proud of yourselves and you’re going to be proud of your country again .
so thank you very much everybody .
this is a great , great honor .
thank you !
get out and vote !
i love you all !
thank you !
thank you very much !
thank you !
thank you .
i feel so badly .
outside we have 5,000 people and they can’t get in .
i feel badly .
i want to apologize .
we have speakers outside .
but i want to apologize .
who would have thought we have over 5,000 people can not get in .
... it’s an honor to be here .
it’s an honor to be with you .
and very important .
you know , we’re doing really well and millions of votes ahead of cruz .
millions .
you know , i get a kick .
i call him _UNK_ ted .
_UNK_ ted cruz .
he stands up – and i win as you know , you’ve seen it .
i have been winning all of the _UNK_ vote .
but he stands up _UNK_ high , puts it down and then he lies .
you know , it’s amazing to watch it .
but he said , `` yeah , i’m the only one who can beat donald trump .
i’ve done it time after time . ''
and i said , `` wait a minute .
i’ve won like most of the states . ''
i think he had like 5 or 6 and i had 20 or _UNK_ right ?
and i said i can’t believe it .
and i have millions of votes more .
he says , `` i’m the only one that can _UNK_ him . ''
and i’m saying but i have like millions of votes more .
i’ll tell you something so important .
there is something happening .
it’s like a movement .
it’s incredible .
it’s a movement .
and we’re part of the movement .
not me .
i’m a _UNK_ to be honest .
i’m a _UNK_ .
and this is something that’s so special and so amazing and it’s on the cover of time magazine .
it’s on the cover of every newspaper .
it’s something that has maybe never happened and they’re saying it’s _UNK_ .
sometimes they say i’m a _UNK_ .
i’m not .
the message is what we want .
we want jobs .
we want trade deals that are smart deals not _UNK_ deals .
and you know , wisconsin .
i wrote down some _UNK_ ... and it’s like devastating .
so [ scott ] _UNK_ came out today .
i wrote down _UNK_ about wisconsin .
look , he certainly can’t _UNK_ me after what i did to him in the race .
right ?
but look at this .
by the summer of _UNK_ , wisconsin was facing a $ _UNK_ billion _UNK_ budget deficit .
that’s terrible .
by the way , these are out of books .
like this isn’t trump .
this is out of books .
total state debt is $ 45 billion .
now , maybe somebody is going to tell me that’s wrong but again these are – $ 45 billion .
very high .
one of the higher ones .
20,000 fewer people in the labor force in wisconsin than seven years ago even though population has grown by _UNK_ so your population is higher .
now , i wouldn’t have done this but he _UNK_ cruz .
what am i going to do ?
am i going to say he’s doing a great job ?
he’s not doing a great job .
you know , he comes in with his big _UNK_ _UNK_ and big _UNK_ .
i love _UNK_ .
right ?
but the _UNK_ guys like trump .
they really like trump .
and he doesn’t look like a _UNK_ guy to me .
i’m sorry .
i’m sorry .
unemployment rate – well , they say – that can’t be possible .
unemployment – they have down 20 % .
that can’t be possible .
what ?
is it 20 % ?
effective or regular ?
effective unemployment rate 20 % .
hey , this is out of the big book .
800,000 food _UNK_ _UNK_ .
middle class hit very , very hard due to loss of manufacturing jobs .
these are the _UNK_ .
right ?
you know about this , right ?
it goes on and on .
wisconsin has lost 15,000 net jobs to mexico since _UNK_ .
now , just so you understand , _UNK_ is running also .
we forget about him .
he voted for _UNK_ .
both of them want _UNK_ .
_UNK_ – trans-pacific partnership .
both of them want trans-pacific .
that will make _UNK_ look like a baby , and wisconsin will be hit so hard .
... ... but the _UNK_ guys love trump .
i love the disabled veterans and the veterans .
we’re going to take care of our veterans .
you know that , right ?
we’re going to take care of our veterans .
what is it about trump that they like ?
i’m serious .
we went to _UNK_ head .
we went to different places , and there were hundreds , hundreds of _UNK_ out there .
beautiful _UNK_ .
_UNK_ of _UNK_ , right ?
_UNK_ of _UNK_ .
made in america .
but beautiful , beautiful _UNK_ ... i don’t know what it is but they like me .
i feel good with them .
i feel safe .
i got out took a picture .
secret service went _UNK_ .
i said , `` these are great people .
don’t worry about it . ''
but listen , i appreciate it , _UNK_ , i appreciate it .
... we’re going to keep you free .
i’m going to keep you free .
because we’re getting rid of isis .
we’re going to have good borders .
we’re going to have borders again .
we’re going to have borders again .
so here we have something that’s pretty interesting – i love you too .
you lost _UNK_ jobs to china .
_UNK_ jobs .
100,000 illegal immigrants living in wisconsin .
taxpayers are paying tens of millions of dollars .
look , i don’t know .
i don’t know .
so what happened with _UNK_ and i just will finish off with this – he’s a nice man .
he came up to my office like about a year ago before i did – you know , i’ve been a politician for about eight months , right ?
i never thought i’d be a politician .
the last thing on my mind i want to be was a politician .
but i built a great company .
i _UNK_ papers .
the company is incredible .
very little debt , tremendous cash flow , some of the great assets in the world .
and i say that not in a _UNK_ way .
i say that because that’s the kind of thinking we need , folks .
we can’t have china _UNK_ us off and mexico and japan and vietnam .
we can’t have it .
we can’t have it .
and they are _UNK_ us like they’ve never ripped anybody before .
we’ve rebuilt china .
i mean , we’re rebuilding mexico .
you look the other day you saw carrier moving down .
carrier air _UNK_ .
i buy those air _UNK_ – a lot of them .
i’m not buying any more of them .
but carrier air _UNK_ moving to mexico .
ford moving to mexico .
_UNK_ – home of the _UNK_ wonderful _UNK_ which we don’t eat anymore .
right ?
we don’t eat it .
we don’t eat it .
number one , it’s a good – it’s called an enforced _UNK_ .
but you know what ?
look , we’re losing our jobs .
look at your jobs .
when i see that statistic , i mean you’re losing your jobs .
when i went after your governor when he decided to run and i said , `` you know , i’m going to be nice to him .
he’s a nice guy . ''
the guy came up to my office .
he handed me a _UNK_ because i supported him .
what do i know ?
i supported him .
i gave $ 50,000 or $ 100,000 .
that’s a lot of money for a guy you’ve never met before .
right ?
that’s pretty good .
but i like the fact that he was fighting , fighting , he was always fighting .
you know , to a certain extent , i’d rather see somebody able to make a deal without having to go through all of that mess .
but he was fighting and i gave him a lot of money and he came up , you know , a year ago or so and he gave me a _UNK_ .
beautiful picture of something .
i haven’t – i never really got to read it to be honest .
and i put it aside .
that was it ... because if we win wisconsin , it’s going to be like over , pretty much over .
because we’re going to do great .
... _UNK_ poll came out .
i think i have _UNK_ % , _UNK_ % in new york compared to like 10 % or whatever , and you have cruz talk about new york values , new _UNK_ are no good .
i watched new _UNK_ rebuild the world trade center .
i watched new _UNK_ dying .
believe me , new _UNK_ are good .
new _UNK_ are very good .
but cruz said they’re no good .
so _UNK_ , so i think we’re going to do great in new york .
we’re going to do great in new jersey .
chris _UNK_ _UNK_ me .
we’ll do great in new jersey .
good guy .
ben _UNK_ _UNK_ me .
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ me .
_UNK_ joe from arizona .
we love _UNK_ joe .
and you know , with the _UNK_ , i’ve had so many ministers .
i’ve had so many pastors _UNK_ me .
and _UNK_ _UNK_ , jr. _UNK_ me .
it was incredible and we’ve done so well with the _UNK_ .
i mean , christians , _UNK_ , we’ve done so well .
in fact , in south carolina , when we went to south carolina , that was going to be _UNK_ territory .
he was going take it , except we won it in a _UNK_ .
you know that .
you saw it .
he was there .
this guy follows me around , i’ll tell you .
but you were there .
remember , he was going to win that in a _UNK_ .
and then i started speaking .
i started talking to people , and i started saying the good and the bad and the ugly .
and we won in a _UNK_ and we won the _UNK_ .
i’ve won just about i think almost every place i’ve won with _UNK_ .
and it’s been an amazing time .
so now i’m here to talk to the people of wisconsin .
i have friends in wisconsin .
i’ve been here before .
it’s an incredible place but it’s a place that has problems .
but you have a governor that has you convinced that it doesn’t have a problem .
i remember when he was on the campaign trail , i was so nice to him .
i said , `` how can i hit him ?
i’m not going to hit him .
i’m not going to hit him . ''
and i was so nice .
i hit _UNK_ instead , right ?
right ?
and i hit _UNK_ , _UNK_ , old _UNK_ .
and i hit a lot of people and they all went down .
wouldn’t it be nice to have a president that could just with his _UNK_ make things happen that are positive ?
you know .
but it’s not with the _UNK_ .
it’s really with the _UNK_ , the heart , and the brain .
remember the brain .
i have a lot of friends .
they’re good with the _UNK_ but they’re not good with the brain .
it all doesn’t work .
okay ?
you know , we had an interesting thing today .
a poll came out – a nationwide poll .
a great poll .
it was trump _UNK_ % .
it was an _UNK_ poll .
trump _UNK_ % .
cruz was second in the _UNK_ , _UNK_ something .
and _UNK_ was way down .
so what happened is they showed the poll .
it was an _UNK_ poll .
they call it an _UNK_ _UNK_ poll .
and it was on the today show , and it was on morning joe .
morning joe held it up and he said , `` _UNK_ , those are great numbers . ''
_UNK_ % is pretty good .
you have three people .
you know .
i don’t get enough credit for that .
i’ve been at _UNK_ % , _UNK_ % , 45 % , and i’ve had like seven people .
how do you get 45 % when you have seven people ?
nobody says that .
they say , `` he hasn’t _UNK_ 50 % . ''
how do you crack 50 % when you have all these people running ?
so i’m at _UNK_ % .
poll was good – way , way ahead of anybody else nationwide .
and they showed hillary clinton – _UNK_ is very close .
she’s got a little problem .
could happen .
got a bigger problem with the emails than she has with _UNK_ to be honest with you .
she should have .
her bigger problem should be with emails .
we’ll find out how honest our country is , right ?
but she’s got a sort of close race .
and they put her poll up and it was put up there .
you know , big letters .
and then they said , `` and donald trump is winning . ''
that was it .
they didn’t put numbers up .
they didn’t say i’m doing great .
in fact , they said , `` donald trump is winning , '' and they put some – a little slightly negative statistic in – it was like wait a minute .
they put her numbers up and they didn’t put my numbers up .
folks , it’s so unfair .
the press is so _UNK_ .
it’s _UNK_ .
that was chuck todd .
that was chuck todd this morning on the today show .
they put _UNK_ numbers .
and i’m winning by a lot and they said , `` donald trump is winning .
you know , let’s go to a new subject , okay ? ''
now , i guarantee you one thing .
if i was losing or doing poorly , _UNK_ still be up .
_UNK_ be up all morning because they don’t like what’s happening .
i’m _UNK_ my campaign .
i’m putting up my own money .
they don’t like it .
ted cruz and _UNK_ are getting money from the banking industries , the energy industries .
they’re getting money from the _UNK_ companies .
they’re getting money from everybody .
folks , you can’t _UNK_ out this mess – we’re in a mess – if you can’t do what you have to do .
when millions of dollars are given to cruz and _UNK_ and millions from different industries , you’re not going to be able to say , `` well , we’re going to do and go against the banking industry to do what’s right for the people '' if the banking industry gave you millions of dollars .
now , that’s true with hillary also .
now , she’s gotten millions of dollars .
but i’m the only one _UNK_ my campaign .
i’m in for a lot of money .
i in a lot of money .
what is beautiful is when i was running against _UNK_ in new hampshire .
i was in for like $ 2 million .
_UNK_ was in for like $ _UNK_ million .
i was in first and he was close to last .
i said , `` who do you want as your president ? ''
by the way , did _UNK_ _UNK_ anybody yet ?
because i haven’t heard .
because i think _UNK_ probably _UNK_ – _UNK_ ?
did he _UNK_ ?
it just shows you how important it is .
nobody even knows .
i don’t even know .
he’ll probably – he’ll _UNK_ – just so you know .
look , when you’re in war , you’ve got to fight and you fight hard .
when i fight , i win .
you’re going to win .
you know that .
you’re going to win .
but you know , you do pretty serious damage , right ?
because you want to win and you want to win fast and a lot of people don’t love you after you finish .
but i just love you .
i don’t care about that .
in fact , they’re asking cruz , you know , at the debate which by the way they said i won every single debate .
now i heard the other night , `` i want to debate trump '' .
i’ve debated him 11 or 12 times .
every single online poll has me winning the debates .
he’s an okay _UNK_ but he’s a bad _UNK_ .
you know , _UNK_ so dramatic .
and he _UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
and he _UNK_ .
you know , you ever see he goes sentence after sentence and then he stops for like three , four _UNK_ .
and then he goes again .
it looks like we’re in the theater .
we’re not in the theater .
we’re in the real world .
so what happens – thank you .
... by the way , the _UNK_ is here and he’s a great guy and his people are _UNK_ .
thank you , _UNK_ .
thank you .
i mean , the only thing i feel so _UNK_ about all the people outside .
feel so _UNK_ .
we’re going to come back .
we’re going to come back , come back to this area .
you guys can not come .
okay ?
all of the ladies can come but the guys can’t .
but all of the people outside , we’re going to take a bigger place because i feel slightly _UNK_ .
but look , we have a very serious mess on our hands .
we have a very serious situation .
we have a country that’s not protected .
we have a country that’s sitting on a big _UNK_ bubble that’s going to _UNK_ .
in a certain way , i’d say let it do now , don’t do it after i get in .
three days _UNK_ _UNK_ and they’ll say it’s _UNK_ fault .
okay ?
_UNK_ , we are in a big _UNK_ ugly bubble .
we have interest rates that are so low that if you’re rich like me i can borrow money for any amount .
if you’re a hardworking guy with a great farm or you’re a hardworking _UNK_ or _UNK_ you can’t borrow money .
you can only borrow money really _UNK_ – think of how bad it is – you can borrow money for nothing _UNK_ if you’re rich .
but if you’re rich , you don’t need the money so you don’t have to borrow it .
but if you’re a _UNK_ and you want to go to the bank for a loan , you can’t get it .
the regulators are running the banks .
_UNK_ is a disaster , by the way .
it’s a disaster .
it’s a disaster .
but the biggest disasters are regulations .
our rules and regulations are _UNK_ .
we’re going to get rid of probably 85 % of them .
there are some we live with .
but we’ve got to go back .
so many people in this area have told me regulations – regulatory climate – is the worst they’ve ever seen .
i have a friend , who’s a _UNK_ , and if a _UNK_ forms , they consider it a _UNK_ for the purposes of environmental .
it’s like a _UNK_ and they’d consider it a _UNK_ .
so we don’t know what we’re doing .
so here’s what’s happening .
we’re going to make our country so great again .
we’re going to make our country so strong again .
our military is going to be so amazing .
we’re never going to have to use it .
don’t forget , i didn’t want to go into iraq .
all these guys think that i’m a tough guy so i’m going to be so quick with the trigger .
i’m not going to be quick .
i was the slowest with the trigger .
i didn’t want the trigger .
now , when obama left though , he shouldn’t have left the way he did .
he gave a certain date , and the enemy said , `` it can’t be possible .
nobody would be that _UNK_ .
nobody . ''
so i actually don’t think _UNK_ hurt that much because i don’t think the enemy would ever believe that anybody would be _UNK_ enough to give a date – `` we’re leaving on this date . ''
and then he left .
they said , `` he was serious ! ''
they pulled back .
they pulled back .
then you see what happened .
they pulled back then they went in with _UNK_ .
but how about the 50 soldiers .
he sent a couple of months ago , a few months ago , he sent 50 of our finest and instead of just sending them quietly , quietly sending them .
what does he do ?
he sends them in and he makes a big press conference or announcement that `` we are sending 50 soldiers in iraq , syria '' and these soldiers have a big target on their backs .
why can’t we just keep our _UNK_ shut ?
why can’t we be _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ ?
right ?
why can’t we be _UNK_ ?
why does he have to tell – first of all , it doesn’t even sound good when you say `` 50 soldiers '' because it sounds like so small .
people would say , `` is that good or bad ? ''
i mean , that sounds small .
but then when you think about it , why do we have to say that ?
these are extraordinary people .
these are our finest .
and they’re , you know , very dangerous missions .
why would you tell people that we’re sending them in ?
you just keep quiet and let them accomplish something .
they are right now – who knows what’s happened to them ?
but right now , they have a big target on their back .
people that we’ve let go of at _UNK_ have now killed americans .
you’ve seen that .
you saw that yesterday .
that came out yesterday .
we let people go out of _UNK_ and they kill americans .
okay .
is anybody surprised at that though ?
would anybody be surprised ?
and we’re keeping it open .
now they’re spending , you know , hundreds of millions to run it .
i guarantee you could run it a lot cheaper .
you’d have a lot of money left over .
so we’re going to get efficiency in government .
but we’re going to end obamacare .
we’re going to replace it with something so much better and so much less expensive .
we’re going to get rid of common core .
we’re going to bring our education local .
we are going to preserve our second amendment .
it’s under siege .
it’s _UNK_ under siege .
and _UNK_ is under siege .
i’ll tell you , _UNK_ is under siege .
you take a look .
i’m with the – i’ll tell you what .
i’ve been with so many pastors lately and _UNK_ _UNK_ jr. was an example – was telling me that – first of all , he told me something that `` you remind me so much of my father . ''
i thought his father was a great guy .
what his father did with liberty college and liberty university .
and _UNK_ to top it off has taken it to a whole new place .
but when _UNK_ was so strong and so great .
but i was talking to – i probably had 50 of the ministers and pastors , different folks came up to my office , and they’re really under tremendous pressure because they don’t want to have their tax exempt status taken away .
this happened during the lyndon johnson presidency .
and i said , `` why is it that you folks are pushed around so much ? ''
_UNK_ .
these are the pastors .
these are strong people .
these are really strong people .
`` why do you allow that ?
why aren’t you more _UNK_ ? ''
and finally , somebody said , `` well , we have to be a little careful of our tax exempt status . ''
i said when did that happen exactly ?
it was during the johnson .
well , we’re going to try to get rid of that .
okay ?
because that’s really terrible .
we’re going to try getting rid of – and i’ve said that to a lot of _UNK_ , a lot of great christians .
we’re going to try to get rid of it because it sort of means somebody walking down the street has more power than somebody of religion , of our religion , of _UNK_ , somebody that’s an _UNK_ .
you take anybody they have more power because these people are powerless .
they’ve actually taken their right of free speech away .
so i said we’re going to try to get rid of that and i think we’ll be very , very successful .
you know , it’s interesting .
i said how many christians are there ?
because you know , we’ve got men , we’ve got women .
you cut it in half , we’ve actually have a few more women .
but we are far more christians than we have men or women .
so in a way , it’s the most powerful _UNK_ – the biggest group of people .
but they’re not allowed to talk because they’re _UNK_ .
you saw what was happening with the irs and what was taking place with regard to certain groups .
so we are going to try and usually when i say try that means i’m going to get it done .
that means i’m going to get it done .
but we are going to try very hard .
we are going to get that brought back and i think it’s going to be very hard to counter it .
because if the christians , and if the whole _UNK_ christian sector gets together , nobody , nobody can beat – you know , when i made the statement about _UNK_ muslims on a temporary basis , i took such heat .
now people are saying , `` you know , trump is sort of right about that . ''
now they’re all going , `` _UNK_ '' because they see what’s happening .
and i think if i would have said it about christians , i think i would have had less opposition .
that’s what’s happened in this country .
that’s what’s happened in our country .
and we can’t let it happen .
we’re going to turn this country around and we’re going to be the smart people .
we’re not going to be the _UNK_ anymore .
we’re not going to be where china made last year trade deficits $ _UNK_ billion .
japan over $ 100 billion .
mexico $ _UNK_ billion .
we’re going to build a wall and mexico is going to pay for the wall .
okay ?
... recently , i was in florida and _UNK_ , who’s a nice guy actually .
you notice how nice they are after you’ve defeated them ?
i like everybody i defeat .
but when i ran against _UNK_ , it was supposed to be ... well , he started it .
right ?
just like cruz started the last deal .
he started it .
but _UNK_ came after me very _UNK_ .
you know he wanted to be _UNK_ _UNK_ , right ?
and it didn’t work .
but what happened is i won by 20 points – almost 20 points – and a lot of these issue we were talking about it was big issues .
and frankly , i wish i would have left about two days earlier .
i wanted to stay in florida campaign .
i wish i would have devoted two more days to ohio because i almost won in ohio .
i would have won in ohio but i didn’t want to take a chance leaving my beautiful florida because i love florida and i wanted to win that .
so if i would have left a couple of days early , i think i would have won florida the same .
but i’m not going to have anything happen in wisconsin .
we have to win .
if we – look , we have to put these politicians in their place , folks .
it’s time .
and believe me , you know , cruz likes to pretend he’s an _UNK_ and in the meantime he gets all the _UNK_ support , including your governor .
so believe me , believe me , they’re all _UNK_ .
and frankly in a way it’s worse because cruz is _UNK_ and yet he’s got no relationship with the _UNK_ .
he goes and he stands on the floor of the senate for a day and a half and he _UNK_ , and these senators – look , i know .
they’re tough _UNK_ .
i have the best – i have one of the great people – _UNK_ jeff _UNK_ , who’s great .
nobody better than jeff .
and you know , cruz thought he was going to have him and used him in his speech – `` _UNK_ jeff _UNK_ '' – and then he comes out and he _UNK_ me .
but when you think of it , look , out of all of these senators , he has one supporter – lee – who’s his friend .
i mean , he’s his friend .
and by the way took him plenty time to do it .
but you know , to stand there and to _UNK_ and _UNK_ for two days to show people you can _UNK_ , in the meantime , nothing was accomplished .
cruz has not accomplished one thing .
so he’s an _UNK_ but it’s almost like the man on the street because he can’t get anything done .
he _UNK_ people .
he calls people like for instance he said _UNK_ things about the speaker and you know about the speaker and he said about _UNK_ mitch mcconnell .
i mean , he said some terrible things about – how do you get things done when you’re calling mitch mcconnell bad names .
okay ?
let’s just say bad names .
so he’s sort of got the worst of all elements .
he’s an _UNK_ _UNK_ but he can get nothing done .
okay ?
he can get nothing done .
your new speaker – how do you like paul ryan ?
how do you like him ?
_UNK_ .
i was told be nice to paul ryan because – really ?
well , he’s the speaker .
he’s a nice guy .
he called me the other day .
he was very nice .
but i’m very surprised at this statement .
_UNK_ .
are you all republicans ?
are you mostly _UNK_ ?
... i always say i’m just a common sense conservative .
and so , so important – common sense .
and somebody told me today that somebody else – i think , _UNK_ – used my term .
you know , _UNK_ used – i said , `` make america great again . ''
i said , `` make america great again '' , and i _UNK_ the term .
and then _UNK_ was making a speech many months ago when he first started and he was saying `` make america great again '' because he saw the response that i got .
the difference is he didn’t get any response .
so then no .
but we told him he can’t do that .
that was the first real problem i had with him ... now , i said a common sense conservative and today i heard he used the term because the press was up and they _UNK_ me and they said he said he’s a common sense conservative .
well , i _UNK_ the _UNK_ a few months ago .
that’s what i am .
i am a conservative .
i’m very , very conservative on the military .
i’m very conservative with our vets and on health care and on _UNK_ of things .
but – and i’m actually very conservative on trade but a lot of people would say `` he’s not that conservative on trade because he doesn’t believe in free trade . ''
well , actually i do believe in free trade .
but it’s got to be good trade for us , right ?
it’s got to be smart trade .
it can’t be where wisconsin is losing thousands and thousands of jobs where you folks can’t get into china but china comes in here like it’s _UNK_ _UNK_ .
that’s what happens .
you know , china does not _UNK_ the rules .
now , i get along great with china .
i made a fortune dealing with china .
i have two buildings because of china .
big ones in new york and one in san _UNK_ – bank of america – that i have in partnership with a great company .
and it’s because of china .
i sell – i have one of the big _UNK_ with one of their big banks – with the biggest bank in the world actually from china .
i sell millions of millions of _UNK_ to people from china .
i like china .
i’m not angry china .
i like them .
i think their leaders are doing a great job for them .
but our leaders are doing a bad job for us .
same with mexico .
i get along great .
the _UNK_ .
i love the _UNK_ .
i love the _UNK_ .
but their leaders are killing us on the border and they’re killing us on trade .
and i’m not angry at them .
i’m angry at our country and our leadership because it’s _UNK_ _UNK_ and we’re going to change it around and we’re going to get the best and we’re going to get the finest .
... so whatever you can do to spread the world , i’ll be around .
i’m going to green bay .
i love their team , by the way .
you talk about a great _UNK_ .
no , i love it .
and you have a truly great _UNK_ .
i don’t know .
he’s probably _UNK_ somebody else but i don’t care .
he’s still a great _UNK_ .
tom _UNK_ a friend of mine .
he said you have a great _UNK_ .
that’s all right with me .
when tom says he’s a great _UNK_ that’s pretty good .
but you know , i really want to win wisconsin because if we could win wisconsin , we’re going to put all of this _UNK_ away .
we’re going to put these _UNK_ , _UNK_ people that allow and i’m talking about basically politicians , and in many cases , you know a lot of times people will see deals that are done and i mean take a look at the iran deal .
how bad is that i mean , just as a deal ... but many times people will say deals that the country makes , and they’ll say , `` how can our politicians be so _UNK_ ? ''
they’re not _UNK_ .
they’re being hit by the lobbyists and the special interests and they make a fortune .
okay ?
they get tremendous campaign contributions .
they’re not _UNK_ .
they’re doing it for themselves .
so again , i’m not doing that .
i’m doing for you .
i’m working for you .
but just remember , they’re not so _UNK_ like you think .
but when you look at the people funding _UNK_ campaign and _UNK_ campaign , and you look – don’t forget – cruz said , `` oh the banks , the banks . ''
you know , he’s going to be _UNK_ _UNK_ .
he’s going to be this great guy .
and then in her personal financial _UNK_ form , he forgot to mention that he borrowed about a million dollars from the banks – _UNK_ and _UNK_ _UNK_ .
he borrowed a million dollars at an interest rate that everybody in this room would be proud to have – a very low interest rate .
almost no interest .
he forgot to announce it on his personal financial _UNK_ form .
he just forgot .
he said , `` oh , i forgot .
i forgot . ''
okay ?
so then he hits the banks .
he’s controlled by these people , folks .
okay ?
i mean , what he did was absolutely wrong .
but they’re controlled by these people .
i’m controlled by you .
i’m going to do the right thing for you .
okay ?
so remember that .
... q & a 22 veterans a day commit suicide .
that’s correct .
we’re going to take care of our veterans so much .
look , let me tell you , they – many of them kill themselves waiting for a doctor .
they can’t even get to see the doctor .
you know that .
they end up killing themselves before they see the doctor .
22 a day and a lot of people don’t even believe that number .
they think it’s almost like an impossible number – how can it be so bad ?
– and it actually could be even worse than that .
we are going to take care of them .
from their _UNK_ , they wait , they wait , then they get bad service , then they wait some more – six , seven , eight days .
and sometimes they’ll see the doctor and the doctor says , `` i can’t see you now .
i’m going on vacation . ''
you see the _UNK_ .
i just left phoenix – _UNK_ people .
_UNK_ joe was there .
the job he did was incredible .
incredible .
you know they had a little protest .
right ?
that protest ended so quickly .
he arrested three people ; everyone else scattered .
you know , and you have that kind of a _UNK_ here .
you have a tough _UNK_ here .
i can tell you .
i just met him and i can tell you .
but you know i have a great policy plan and i’ve gotten a lot of credit for it and it’s on _UNK_ .
and with the veterans when they’re waiting for _UNK_ time – even for a little time – they’re going to go to the doctor .
they’re going to go to local doctors or local hospitals .
many of the hospitals are dying for business .
you know that they’re dying .
some of these hospitals are dying .
they’re going to get immediate treatment , immediate service , we’re going to pay the bills , and we’re going to save a fortune , and they’re going to get great service .
and everybody is in love with it .
everybody loves it .
and that’s what’s going to happen .
so we’re going to take care of our veterans .
if we can’t take care of our veterans , we can’t take care of anyone .
so we’re going to take care of our vets .
boy , do you look good though .
you look good and tough .
i wouldn’t want to fight you .
do you think i can take you in a fight ?
i don’t think so .
how about we do it right now ?
that would be great for television ... go ahead .
... let me tell you this .
our veterans are taken worse care of than illegal immigrants who come in our country ... you don’t even have to write it down .
we’re going to do things about it .
you know what you’re saying ?
i’ve heard this so many times before with the _UNK_ and everything else .
we are going to take care of our vets .
by the ways , speaking of increase , cruz and _UNK_ want to destroy your social security , folks , okay ?
i want to bring money back into this country .
i want to bring jobs into this country .
i want to bring tremendous wealth into this country .
i want to take our wealth back from china , from mexico , from all of these countries that have our wealth .
they’ve taken them like we’re a bunch of _UNK_ .
and we’re going to save your social security and we’re going to save your medicare .
they want to get rid of it .
okay ?
remember that .
... i want to use not too many executive orders folks .
you know , because executive orders came about more recently .
nobody ever heard of an executive order .
then all of a sudden obama , because he couldn’t get anybody to agree with him and he start signing them like they’re _UNK_ .
so i want to do away with executive orders for the most part .
but look , just do me a favor .
stick with me .
you’re going to be okay .
all right ?
... i know , what you’ve said i’ve heard a hundred times and _UNK_ is a huge problem .
huge problem .
and your wife not working ?
huge problem – she can’t .
so anyway , i bet you have a great wife .
good wife ?
better believe it .
... we’re ending common core .
you’re not going to be educated – your kids in wisconsin are no longer going to be educated in washington , d.c. by bureaucrats – many of whom – i can’t say all – but many of whom don’t care for your kids .
they couldn’t care less .
they get big , _UNK_ salaries .
your kids are going to be educated _UNK_ .
we’re _UNK_ common core , and you will see something that’s magic .
and i’ve seen it where parents and all of these people – the uncles , the aunts – they’re all on the school _UNK_ .
they get professionals .
they have great principals .
you can’t see what’s going on from washington , d.c. many of the people never even come here .
they sit behind their desk in washington .
they draw big salaries .
and they’re telling you how to educate their kids .
not going to happen that way .
and i’ve even seen it where they keep graduates – the child graduates and those parents stay on .
they love it because their child went through the system .
they love it and they become so good at it .
that’s what’s going to happen .
we’re one of the worst in the world in education .
we’re going to be one of the better ones .
not necessarily – you know , i don’t know that we’re going to beat _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , and china .
but we’re going to come very close .
discipline in schools .
i don’t think that wisconsin should have a big problem with discipline .
you have a big problem with discipline ?
... well , we have to get discipline back in the country , forget about school .
we have to get discipline – i mean , i have a case .
i have a wonderful guy – campaign manager .
you talk about discipline .
and you probably saw what happened today with my campaign manager .
he’s a good guy .
_UNK_ [ _UNK_ ] .
and by the way , the easiest thing – `` _UNK_ , you’re fired . ''
i can’t do that .
can’t do it .
so fortunately , i have a _UNK_ system .
you know , very – i’m rich so i have _UNK_ all over .
so this young woman who _UNK_ , was all – she was talking about being maybe thrown to the floor and all this .
i said , `` oh , that’s _UNK_ . ''
and then we saw the _UNK_ .
did anybody see the tape ?
what did you think ?
right ?
nothing .
women – what did you think ?
[ audience response inaudible ] ... i mean , she wasn’t like – her face stayed the same .
if somebody _UNK_ your arm or did something really bad – don’t forget – initially she said thrown to the floor .
but if somebody _UNK_ your arm or hurt you , wouldn’t you start screaming or something ?
did you see any change in her face ?
[ audience response inaudible ] ... it’s _UNK_ .
it’s _UNK_ .
honestly , it’s _UNK_ .
and the best thing i could do is say – but i can’t destroy a man .
i’d destroy him .
got a beautiful wife and children and i’m not going to destroy a man for that .
and you know what ?
when i saw that at the tape , at first i said , `` oh , this is terrible . ''
then i saw the tape .
it’s my tape .
i’m the one that had the tape .
it’s on the ceiling of this incredible _UNK_ in _UNK_ , florida , and we’re all leaving and we have a press conference .
right ?
and the press conference _UNK_ a long time .
it was like 45 minutes .
so that was enough .
i’m leaving with a whole big _UNK_ of people .
people pushing left and right , left and right .
and all of a sudden , she _UNK_ into the picture .
she _UNK_ me or hits me on the arm .
in fact , i’m like this with my arm up and then he goes by and maybe he touched her a little bit .
but i didn’t – it was almost like he was trying to keep her off me .
right ?
[ audience response inaudible ] like he was helping her .
and did you see her fall to the ground ?
[ audience response inaudible ] okay , because she talked about falling to – now after , i must tell you , her statement changed big league because she said go to the ground .
you know , all this .
i could read it to you .
does anybody want to hear it ?
i mean , i want to be accurate because i’d like the press to treat me .
so before she knew she was on tape , she said `` i was _UNK_ backwards . ''
was she _UNK_ backwards ?
i mean , if she was , her face stayed the same .
i mean .
`` i was _UNK_ backwards .
someone _UNK_ me _UNK_ by the arm and _UNK_ me me down .
campaign managers aren’t supposed to forcefully throw reporters to the ground , except she never went to the ground .
she never even came – _UNK_ .
she didn’t – you know , if somebody _UNK_ you even one of the guys , even the _UNK_ , if somebody _UNK_ even a _UNK_ or _UNK_ you a little bit , you’re `` _UNK_ ! ''
right ?
i mean , the toughest guy , the toughest woman .
look at her face .
it’s zero .
they’re going to destroy a man’s life ?
and then i have cruz saying , `` oh , that was a terrible thing .
that was a terrible thing . ''
let me tell you something , folks .
if i win , if i lose , i didn’t need to do this .
i’m doing this because i just had a beautiful _UNK_ with _UNK_ .
_UNK_ and _UNK_ – beautiful , beautiful _UNK_ .
it’s my _UNK_ .
i’m doing this all for them .
i didn’t need to do this .
this is not so easy .
and i had no idea .
you know , maybe none of us did .
you know , i had no idea the message was going to get across .
it’s a message of _UNK_ .
it really is .
it’s a message of common sense and it’s a message of _UNK_ .
and i had no idea that we’d have millions of more votes than we had when we had that _UNK_ mitt romney – a total _UNK_ – who by the way he’s a _UNK_ .
he’s not a smart person .
i’ll tell you right now .
let me tell you about mitt romney .
that was an election he should have won and he lost .
and he should just go away and let the big boys do it now because you know what ?
that’s an election that should have been won .
and i’ll tell you what .
i helped john mccain and at that time , honestly , that was a tough deal for him because the world was sort of _UNK_ .
but he lost .
and i helped mitt romney a lot and he lost .
and i said , `` this time , we’re going to do it ourselves .
we’re going to win .
we’re going to win . ''
so just remember that .
we’re going to win because of wisconsin , i hope ... right !
she’s so smart .
i don’t want them to know .
i don’t want to tell putin what i’m thinking .
she’s so smart .
what you just said ... what about ukraine ?
don’t worry about ukraine .
ukraine is going to be fine .
just don’t ask me why .
you know , this world of politics – `` mr. trump , you said - '' don’t forget i’m the one that said take the oil .
i was right .
they didn’t take the oil .
you know who has the oil right now ?
isis has the oil .
you know , that libya – isis has all that oil from _UNK_ , all of that big oil from _UNK_ .
he took it .
we’re like a bunch of _UNK_ .
why aren’t we _UNK_ ?
why aren’t we creating a nice big circle so they can’t get the oil out ?
why aren’t we taking that oil back ?
look , look , look , i’m the one that says though i don’t want to say everything .
if i win , i have a good chance of winning .
i’m the _UNK_ by a lot .
i want to go in there .
i want to knock the hell out of isis .
i don’t want to tell all .
i really mean this .
i don’t want to tell everybody in this room – and look at all the cameras that are going now – i don’t want to tell the world what i’m going to do because they’re watching .
just let me do it folks .
i will do it .
you would be so happy .
you don’t have to know the details .
okay ?
let me do it .
you know , i used the word before .
we have to be a little bit _UNK_ .
we can’t say , `` well , we’re going and attack on march _UNK_ and then we’re going to hit them from the front and then we’re going to hit them from the back . ''
you know , obama did that eight months ago with one of the cities .
he said , `` we’re going in next week . ''
look , folks , folks , folks , you know , you have to trust – there has to be some trust .
right ?
do you trust ?
we’ve got to stop the _UNK_ .
that’s why i really think your question is so great – `` i don’t want to hear how you’re going to do it , mr. trump .
just do it . ''
i’ll do it .
okay ?
i love that .
that woman !
that woman !
thank you , _UNK_ .
thank you .
okay .
i can see why .
woman : thank you .
you have been – i just want to say thank you .
you saved me in so many ways .
in recent years , i’ve been struggling with an _UNK_ illness and i’m on home care now .
it’s caused by a _UNK_ medical _UNK_ .
and in those dark days fighting – right now all the _UNK_ have been removed and i have a do not _UNK_ order and i have a _UNK_ son – in those days in the hospital , i received from you a _UNK_ letter that said , `` to the _UNK_ woman i know . ''
i remember that .
i remember that .
such a wonderful , beautiful woman .
i mean , just an amazing woman .
and are you coming along okay ?
woman : no , sir .
but that’s okay because i’m here right now to thank you in person and that was my biggest dream .
and i wanted to thank you because through you and your organizations , my son who’s _UNK_ , _UNK_ , through your organization and just being able to stand on that stage with you back in _UNK_ the _UNK_ of love that can from that ultimately provided my son when he graduates high school with a full ride to college .
that’s great .
and you know what we’ll do ?
we’re going to watch him .
you’re going to watch him .
we’re going to be watching your boy .
okay ?
but you’re going to be hopefully around .
you’re not going to have to have anybody watching .
you’re going to hopefully be around .
those doctors are going to be so wrong .
but we’ll be helping you .
woman : so we thank you .
god bless you .
and just , you know , he’s a _UNK_ , and you because of your efforts have sent him to college .
and i have been writing letters to him for when i’m in heaven to tell him that what you’ve done for him now he has a great responsibility to pay it forward just as you have done for us .
that’s so nice .
thank you .
i have to go down and say hello .
is that okay ?
... very _UNK_ but i think it’s going to be really a story of hope and something that is really great is going to happen out of that .
you watch .
but it sort of tells me when i first said this people would say , `` oh , it will cost a lot . ''
_UNK_ about the campaign .
that’s _UNK_ by comparison .
you know , i’ve spent tens of millions of dollars .
but the big thing – i lost certain businesses and i owned the miss universe _UNK_ .
i bought it very _UNK_ many years ago – 15 years ago – and because of the fact that they thought i was against this woman or that one , i had a hard time with television .
now , the good news is i sold it for a wonderful – i was very happy with that .
but i didn’t want to sell it .
but i sold it and i built it to really a great company .
we did a great job with that company – miss universe , miss usa , miss teen usa .
but other businesses – i sort of – like the _UNK_ and the ties with _UNK_ .
_UNK_ was _UNK_ _UNK_ because of illegal immigration and they ended the _UNK_ , ties .
who care ?
i mean , that’s not a big deal .
but i’m doing something – nobody is giving up what i’m giving .
i mean , when cruz runs , he runs .
if he _UNK_ , great .
if he _UNK_ , great .
you know , it’s him .
he’s a politician .
they just – they run , they win , they lose , who knows ?
but these guys run for office .
that’s all they do .
i’ve always heard that if you’re a very successful person , you can’t run for office , especially for president .
you just can’t run for president , and i can see it .
i have so much false press about me .
things that are so false .
you know , i saw the other day on television , there were like _UNK_ negative ads on me .
_UNK_ in fact , in florida , i own _UNK_ and in florida we had the _UNK_ there two weeks .
_UNK_ scott – the great _UNK_ scott – the great _UNK_ .
he was winning .
and in between shots , i told you this after the victory speech , in between they have _UNK_ and they were all about trump .
negative , _UNK_ , negative _UNK_ .
mostly false .
mostly .
not all false .
but mostly false , i have to be honest .
but it came out the other day , i think it said `` $ _UNK_ million , _UNK_ negative ads . ''
negative ads .
and when i was running in florida , i said `` how is it possible to win ? ''
i mean , with all of this because i knew it .
you couldn’t turn on in florida where i was you couldn’t turn on the television without seeing trump _UNK_ .
sometimes four or five in a row .
and they were _UNK_ .
done by very , very bad people .
very bad , evil people .
and i said , `` how it is possible to win ? ''
and god helped me .
honestly .
because i won in a _UNK_ .
i won by almost 20 % .
and now they’re doing it here .
_UNK_ for growth .
it’s a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
look , _UNK_ for growth – you ever hear this ?
_UNK_ for growth – a friend of mine , he’s a conservative guy .
he goes would you do me a favor ?
see _UNK_ for growth .
i said , `` what’s _UNK_ for growth ? ''
he said , `` they want to talk to you . ''
i said , `` all right .
send them up . ''
he’s a friend .
he’s a good guy .
and now i’m in politics so i have to see people i wouldn’t _UNK_ ... so _UNK_ for growth , they come up to my office .
this guy was i think a former congressman .
and he tells me a little bit about _UNK_ for growth and i’m falling _UNK_ .
and then he goes , `` $ 1 million . ''
and i said , `` $ 1 million for what ?
i don’t even know you .
i’ve never met you . ''
i said , `` do me a favor . ''
i’m trying to be nice and i said , `` go back and write me a little note if you can . ''
and he was _UNK_ enough to write me a note .
he _UNK_ me a letter asking for $ 1 million .
i let him know that i’m not interested .
you could be rich .
i’d rather take a million and throw it all over this room .
i’d rather give it to you , to your boy .
... they write me a letter .
it’s like _UNK_ .
they asked me for a $ 1 million .
i said no _UNK_ .
and then they’re doing ads all over wisconsin .
_UNK_ for growth .
they did it all over florida .
_UNK_ for growth .
about _UNK_ _UNK_ .
by the way , without _UNK_ _UNK_ , you wouldn’t have highways , you wouldn’t have hospitals , you wouldn’t have bridges .
you need _UNK_ _UNK_ .
if _UNK_ in your way and you’re building a highway , if you’re producing _UNK_ jobs and you need a little corner of _UNK_ property , every once in a while .
you know , it’s funny .
these guys all want the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
right ?
everyone .
_UNK_ .
_UNK_ want the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
i like the _UNK_ _UNK_ too .
but they have a whole big thing on _UNK_ _UNK_ in their _UNK_ because without _UNK_ _UNK_ , they wouldn’t go 15 feet .
they wouldn’t be able to build it .
so , they don’t want _UNK_ _UNK_ .
they do _UNK_ about _UNK_ _UNK_ .
they love the _UNK_ _UNK_ , and the whole _UNK_ _UNK_ is based around _UNK_ _UNK_ because you’ve got to go from canada , where cruz was born , to texas , where he’s _UNK_ .
think of it .
this guy – and don’t forget that .
remember what i said .
i’m going to win .
just remember what i said .
i’m going to win .
and i thank you ... i’m going to win .
but remember this .
if for some reason he does , he gets the nomination , the first thing – remember , i’m a good _UNK_ , i’m a good _UNK_ – the first thing that’s going to happen is the democrats are going to _UNK_ ted cruz .
he was born in canada .
he lived there for four years .
the head of the harvard law school , one of the top people in the business in terms of constitution , is saying that , you know , he’s wrong .
and we have a bunch of other people that are much stronger than even that .
remember this .
if cruz gets lucky and _UNK_ , and the only way he can get lucky is if he doesn’t get – because it’s all _UNK_ .
you know , if i go into that whole mess of the convention , i’m not the _UNK_ .
i don’t take their money .
i don’t hire their people .
i don’t do any of that stuff .
okay ?
so you have a disadvantage .
but if cruz _UNK_ , remember what i said .
just remember .
again , he’s not going to win .
but if he does , he gets the nomination , within the first few days he will be _UNK_ by the democrats that he doesn’t have the right to be president .
and i think they’re right because he wasn’t born on our soil .
he wasn’t born .
he’s not a natural born citizen .
he’s not a natural born citizen .
i don’t like to make a big deal of this but it was just brought up by somebody .
he is not a natural born citizen .
so if for some reason he should get the nomination , i really believe you’re _UNK_ your time and boy do we have a problem because you’re going to have somebody that’s going to be _UNK_ , probably will lose the _UNK_ .
again , he was born there , lived there for four years , mother was there , the whole thing for a long period of time , and he was a _UNK_ citizen joint with u.s. until 14 or 15 months ago .
did anyone know that ?
so he was a senator from texas , only because of the great _UNK_ _UNK_ by the way , without _UNK_ _UNK_ , he could have never won that election .
it was a _UNK_ .
but he was a senator from texas .
he lived – he was a joint citizen .
now , he finally gave up his citizenship to canada like 16 months ago .
he said , `` oh , i didn’t know i was a citizen of canada also . ''
just like he didn’t know that _UNK_ _UNK_ and _UNK_ gave him money .
i mean , this guy is – you just have to study him , folks .
look , again , i’m doing this .
we’re going to win .
we’re going to turn this country around .
we’re going to make america great again .
we’re going to win a lot .
but you have to know the facts .
i love you all .
i love you all .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you very much .
thank you .
get out there and vote !
thank you !
thank you .
thank you !
thank you very much everybody .
this was an amazing evening .
this was a great evening .
they just announced north carolina .
i don’t know if they’ve even announced illinois yet but we’re leading by a lot so i think they’re going to announce it .
florida was so amazing .
and i want to thank our friends .
northern _UNK_ islands have been so incredible , and we picked up nine delegates this morning .
i heard very early in the morning – nine delegates .
that’s a lot .
and i just wanted to thank the governor , _UNK_ _UNK_ , great guy , chairman [ james ] _UNK_ who was a _UNK_ man and that was a very nice start to the day .
that i can tell you .
many things have been happening over the last short period of time .
cnn was very nice .
they came up with a poll .
the poll said _UNK_ % to 14 % and 15 % .
we just had one from the _UNK_ just came out – _UNK_ % .
and it was sort of interesting because i was watching the news a little while ago and one of the commentators , who i’m not particularly _UNK_ of but these are minor details , said `` but donald trump doesn’t get over 50 % '' because i’m at _UNK_ % , 45 % .
actually now according to the _UNK_ , i’m at _UNK_ % .
and i have to explain to these people they don’t understand basic _UNK_ , basic _UNK_ , basic whatever you want to call it .
when i don’t get over 50 % , we have four people .
right ?
we have four people .
do you understand that ?
so when i get _UNK_ % – and this one is an example , i had _UNK_ % and that’s with four people .
that’s an achievement just _UNK_ when you can get over 50 % .
so someday , someday they’re going to understand , someday when we take it all , they’ll understand .
but it is really _UNK_ .
i want to thank my family .
my boy , eric and _UNK_ .
they’ve been working so hard .
_UNK_ and _UNK_ have been amazing .
_UNK_ home right now .
in about two minutes , i’ll call her .
she’s about to have a baby so i don’t know .
we’ve been thinking about that now for a little while but _UNK_ has been so helpful and _UNK_ has been amazing and it’s been just great .
i want to thank _UNK_ for putting up with the fact that i never see him anymore .
and i want to thank _UNK_ .
i never see my _UNK_ and it’s his birthday on sunday so we’re very happy about that .
so it’s a little tough .
you know , we’re going away and he goes , `` when are you going to be come home , _UNK_ ?
when are you coming home ? ''
i said , `` well , in about two and a half weeks . ''
it’s been pretty tough .
you’re traveling all over the place .
it’s really amazing .
yesterday i went up to ohio .
i went up to _UNK_ .
we had an incredible crowd and just amazing people in this country .
we have so , so many great people .
we will someday in the not so distant future if i win – otherwise it’s not going to happen i have to be honest with you .
but apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the united states , not in china , vietnam and all of – and we’re not going to be losing our companies .
you know , our companies are leaving our country rapidly , rapidly , whether it’s carrier air _UNK_ , whether it’s ford , whether it’s _UNK_ .
i was in cleveland and _UNK_ _UNK_ they’re leaving and so many companies are leaving .
and frankly , i’m _UNK_ with it and i’m tired of seeing it and there’s no reason for it .
it’s just gross _UNK_ at the highest level .
we should not allow it to happen .
_UNK_ , great company , _UNK_ company , they’re going to ireland .
and there’s so many more .
you have corporate _UNK_ .
you have people who can’t get their money back into the country because the politicians can’t get along .
they can’t make a deal .
everybody agrees – democrat and republican – everybody agrees the money should come back ... trillion dollars outside of this country .
everybody agrees that the money should be here and the politicians for three years haven’t been able to make a deal .
and we could make a deal .
there’s an example of something that you could do if i sat down with a few of the senators , a few of the congressmen , you could make a deal on that in 10 minutes if you know what you’re doing because everybody wants to do it .
and companies are actually leaving our country to get their money , not only because our taxes are too high , which we’re going to lower by the way .
but companies are leaving our country in order to go and get money that’s their money because there’s no way of bringing it in .
so , we’ve got a long way to go .
but i think at some point it’s going to get done .
this has been very exciting , this whole process .
we started , i was one of 17 people – senators , governors .
i’ve had such great support .
dr. ben _UNK_ the other day _UNK_ us .
great guy .
great guy .
wonderful man .
and chris _UNK_ _UNK_ us .
that was so incredible .
and today _UNK_ _UNK_ came up and _UNK_ us .
she was great .
she is a truly wonderful woman , of the job she’s done in florida is incredible .
you know , so many – we’ve had such incredible support .
paul ryan called me the other day – tremendous call .
i spoke with mitch mcconnell today .
we had a great conversation .
the fact is we have to bring our party together .
we have to bring it together .
we have something happening that actually makes the republican party probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world .
everybody’s writing about it all over europe , all over the world they’re talking about it .
millions of people are coming in to vote .
this was an example of it today .
many , many more people .
i’m looking at the polling _UNK_ .
i’m looking at the different polling _UNK_ all around the country where it’s up .
and the lines are four , five , six blocks long .
and the woman – one woman was there for 40 years .
she’s been working the polls .
and she said , `` we’d have two people here .
we’d have three people .
now look at the line . ''
and the line looked like it was , you know , long .
it was really long .
five deep and long .
and it’s just a different thing .
we have a great opportunity and the people that are voting are democrats are coming in , independents are coming in , and very , very importantly , people that never voted before .
it’s an incredible thing .
i want to pay my respects by the way to todd _UNK_ , _UNK_ husband .
_UNK_ was here .
she was incredible .
she was making a speech on my behalf and _UNK_ and everybody loves her .
and what happened is he was in a very bad accident .
he’s tough as _UNK_ .
he’s going to be fine .
but i just wanted to pay my respects by the way to todd .
so , our _UNK_ when we started and _UNK_ and i came down .
yeah , sit down everybody .
please .
i mean , this is _UNK_ .
we give you seats .
you don’t have to stand .
i’m looking at all these people .
cory , good job , cory .
good job .
and hope and our whole _UNK_ .
right ?
so when this began , _UNK_ and i and i said , `` got to do it . ''
and she was so supportive and she’s been so supportive .
it’s been amazing .
and we have to do it .
we came down the _UNK_ and it was about trade and it was about borders .
and what happened is pretty quickly after that and we were – we shot right up .
i shot right to the top of the polls and have been leading in the polls almost from the beginning without fail .
we went up in june .
most people said i’ll never run .
he’s just going to have fun .
he’s having a good time .
this isn’t necessarily – i mean , i’m having a good time .
you know , i’m having a very nice time .
but you know what ?
i’m working very hard and there is great anger .
believe me .
there is great anger .
one of the _UNK_ was saying , `` is there anger ? ''
and i said ... i was supposed to say , `` no , there’s not .
we love the way things are working .
we love the deal you made with iran .
it’s wonderful .
you give them $ 150 billion .
we get nothing .
we love all the deals .
the trade deals are wonderful .
you lose $ 500 billion a year with china .
we lose $ _UNK_ billion a year in terms of _UNK_ .
it’s a total _UNK_ . ''
we don’t make good deals anymore .
we don’t win anymore .
as a country , we don’t win anymore .
and they asked , `` is there anger from your people ? ''
... they’re not angry people but they want to see the country properly run .
they want to see borders .
they want to see good health care .
they want to see things properly taken care of .
they want our military rebuilt .
our military is in a very bad state .
they want it rebuilt .
very , very importantly , and they want the second amendment by the way protected and protected strongly and that’s going to happen .
and you know what they want so badly ?
they want our veterans taken care of .
our veterans are treated so badly .
so , we started and something happened called paris .
paris happened and paris was a disaster .
that was – there have been many disasters .
but it was paris .
and then we had a case in los _UNK_ where it was in california where the 14 young people were killed .
and it just goes on and on and on .
and what happened with me is this whole run took on a whole new meaning , not just borders , not just good trade deals .
we’re going to make the best trade deals you’ve ever seen .
we’ve got such _UNK_ from carl _UNK_ and the _UNK_ people in business .
and these people are going to be negotiating our deals and they’re the best in the world .
we have the best business people in the world .
we’re going to have such great deals .
we’re going to do so good with trade .
we’re going to do so good on the border .
but it took on a whole new meaning , and the meaning was very simple .
we need protection in our country and that’s going to happen and all of a sudden the poll numbers shot up .
and i’m just very proud to be a part of this .
i think we’re going to go .
we’re going to go on a lot of trips over the next month but i think we’re going to have a great victory .
and i think more importantly than anything else we are going to start winning again .
this country is going to start winning again .
we don’t win anymore .
we don’t win with our military .
we can’t beat isis .
we’re going to knock the hell out of them .
we don’t win at trade – china , everybody , japan , mexico , vietnam , india , name the country .
anybody we deal , anybody we do business with beats us .
we don’t win at trade .
we’re going to win at trade .
we’re going to make our country rich again .
we’re going to make our country great again .
and we need the rich in order to make the great , i’m sorry to tell you .
so , i’m going forward .
we had a _UNK_ evening .
i would have never thought this could have happened .
i guess we’re waiting for one result which possibly will be very successful also .
but to win the states that we’ve won and to win by the _UNK_ and especially , look , this is my second home , florida .
to win by that kind of a number is incredible .
it’s _UNK_ .
and i have to say that number one , i want to congratulate _UNK_ _UNK_ on having run a really tough campaign .
he’s tough .
he’s smart .
and he’s got a great future .
he’s got a great future .
but i have to say and nobody has ever , ever in the history of politics received the kind of negative _UNK_ that i have .
record , record , record .
by the way , mostly false .
i wouldn’t say 100 % but about 90 % .
mostly false , vicious , _UNK_ .
they said it was $ 18 million the first week , meaning last week , and $ 25 million .
it added up to over $ 40 million .
and you explain it to me because i can’t – my numbers went up .
i don’t understand it .
nobody understands it .
my numbers went up .
i mean , it’s been an interesting experience .
last week , _UNK_ scott won at the trump national _UNK_ .
won the big _UNK_ , the world _UNK_ of _UNK_ .
and _UNK_ , who’s a great guy – i guess a lot of you folks saw that – but i’m watching ... we have television _UNK_ all over .
we’re down at this _UNK_ green at _UNK_ and everything is working _UNK_ and then a commercial comes on .
the worst commercial and i’m with these wonderful people from _UNK_ and all these top executives , and i’m saying , `` look over there !
look !
don’t watch it .
don’t .
you don’t want to watch it . ''
i’m saying , `` isn’t the _UNK_ beautiful ?
look !
look !
don’t watch . ''
and they came in waves one after another after another and it was brutal .
and then _UNK_ comes in .
he’s this _UNK_ kid from australia , one of the greatest _UNK_ in the world , made an _UNK_ shot on the _UNK_ hole to win the _UNK_ .
he’s a great champion .
and we’re giving the award .
and just before we break for a commercial , `` we’ll be right back with our great champion from australia , _UNK_ scott '' and here’s the commercial and i said , `` no ! ''
and it was two of them – two of them .
oh , what a day that was .
what a disaster .
what a disaster .
_UNK_ .
so again , i just want to congratulate everybody .
this is a really interesting process .
it’s an amazing process .
it’s very tough .
but it is – by the end , if you get to the end , you can handle a lot of things including pressure because there’s nothing like it .
lies , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ reporters , _UNK_ people .
it’s true .
some are nice .
some are nice .
some really _UNK_ people back there .
and i just want to say we’re going to go forward and we’re going to win .
but more importantly , we’re going to win for the country .
we’re going to win , win , win , and we’re not stopping .
we’re going to have great victories for our country .
thank you very much everybody !
thank you !
... so it’s so important .
you getting out to vote .
it’s just so important because our country has been taken away from us .
it’s going so fast .
and you know , you’re talking about second amendment because i was asking with _UNK_ and a lot of people , i was talking to some of the people before , `` what would you like me to focus on ? ''
and they said , `` just second amendment .
second amendment . ''
now , the second amendment means a lot of other things too ... the second amendment in under siege .
you know that .
you know that very well .
we lost a great supreme court justice and nobody thought this was going to be part of the _UNK_ .
and all of a sudden if somebody gets in that’s the wrong person , they’ll take away that second amendment so fast your head will _UNK_ .
you see bloomberg is somebody that wants to knock out the second amendment .
hillary is a disaster on the second amendment .
no , they want to take it away .
so , it’s just not going to happen .
it’s not going to happen .
... but we lost our wonderful justice who was a great man and a great second amendment person .
i just heard coming up , you know , the senators .
we’ve been very _UNK_ .
i’m a republican .
many of you are republicans .
but we’re not being protected whether it’s a budget .
you saw the budget that was approved a month ago .
it was approved by the republicans .
they gave it away .
they gave obama everything .
so obama wants to put in a supreme court judge .
he said he wants – he’s going to be a very negative person to guns because that’s the way it is , okay ?
believe me , that will be the way it is .
and basically they don’t have the right to do that .
but i keep saying , `` well , are the republicans going to fail or are they going to crack ?
what’s going to happen ? ''
and coming up today , i hear , `` well , there could be a way of obama pushing it through . ''
here we go , right ?
here we go .
same thing you heard with obamacare .
it’s going to be defeated .
it’s going to be _UNK_ .
we’re going to repeal and replace obamacare .
believe me .
but – i mean , look what’s going on with your premiums .
35 % , 45 % , 55 % up .
your _UNK_ is so high .
i mean , you’ve got to see that truck right there ?
you’ve got to get hit by that truck in order to ever use it .
so , i come up and i’m hearing that obama now who said by the way yesterday , `` donald trump will not be the president .
he will not be . ''
no , it’s a _UNK_ .
look , he’s been perhaps the worst president in the history of the united states .
so it’s a _UNK_ .
but he was all over the place yesterday .
said , `` donald trump will not be – `` i think we have maybe a little surprise in store , and we start right here in south carolina .
you know , new hampshire was so amazing .
we had a big , big victory in new hampshire .
amazing people .
and then we come down here and i said , `` you know , i think we have an ever bigger lead over here . ''
and the people have been incredible no matter where we go to speak .
even this .
i know that four years ago , you had about 200 people here for the same kind of thing for your _UNK_ and he’s a good _UNK_ , a good guy , and he did well but you had 400 people , 200 people .
you have thousands of people here and we just appreciate it , and i won’t forget it .
believe me , i’m not going to forget it .
i’m not going to forget it .
so i hear that they’re talking about trying to get a liberal judge and a judge that does not like the second amendment and a judge that – and this is one of many .
this is one of many but a judge that doesn’t want to do a number on the guns and that doesn’t know how important it is .
we’re just not going to let it happen .
okay ?
it’s not going happen .
and if we elected , we know that .
but we have 9 months , 10 months to go .
we have to have the republicans hold fast because i’m just hearing these little cracks , saying `` well , maybe if he _UNK_ somebody , maybe we could get along , maybe . ''
it’s not the way it’s supposed to be .
now , it’s possible that they’ll have their wish because if they win , they’re going to be having their choice .
but if they don’t win , we’re going to start really taking back because we have 3 or 4 or 5 maybe supreme court judges .
this was not supposed to be one in question .
this was a very _UNK_ circumstance that happened with – i mean , really to me it was a very _UNK_ circumstance .
but now we’re going to see what happens .
i will only tell you this .
we are doing well .
we have a really good chance to win .
if we can win in south carolina , we’re going to go – i mean , we could very well run the table .
i don’t know if you saw – i guess a lot of you have seen actually next week in nevada .
it’s going to be _UNK_ .
the relationship there to the people ... bush is 1 % in nevada .
this guy – why doesn’t he just give up , just go home ?
go home .
go home to mom .
got to go home to _UNK_ .
you know , bush is only at 1 % in nevada .
a couple of them are , you know , at 10 % , 11 % , or 12 % .
i’m at like 40 % something – _UNK_ % .
so i think we’re going to do well .
then i think we have the _UNK_ .
we’re going to have the _UNK_ , which is going to be i think amazing .
but really now we’re starting .
new hampshire could not have been better .
they gave us a tremendous _UNK_ .
they really started us on our way .
and we did well in iowa .
i mean , some votes were stolen from ben _UNK_ , which by the way was a _UNK_ .
what cruz – what this guy cruz did with ben _UNK_ was an absolute _UNK_ .
what he did was – he stole .
it’s theft .
and then they come out with a voter violation form , which is a fraud as far as i’m concerned .
and what he did with that whole thing was a _UNK_ .
so we’re not going to let that stuff happen anymore .
i mean , we’re not going to let it .
we will not let it happen .
we’re all watching .
you’re all watching .
keep your eyes wide open .
these politicians – here’s a guy , he raises the _UNK_ and yet he tells _UNK_ , he tells lies , and then he does this stuff to _UNK_ and he does other things .
very bad .
so politicians are bad people .
boy , they are bad .
would you believe it ?
so we’re not going to let it happen and we’re going to get in there ... so saturday .
go out and vote .
this is going to be the place that’s really going to make it .
and honestly , i’ve been watching all the pundits .
now , the bad news is they’re always wrong .
they all said i’m not running and i ran .
well , how is he going to do ?
he’s just doing this for fun .
i’m not doing this for fun .
believe me , i love this _UNK_ but i know i can be someplace else .
okay ?
i could be someplace else right now .
i could be very happy .
but i’m doing it because you know the expression and i see all the _UNK_ in the audience – make america great again .
we are going to make america so ... ... we are going to win again .
you know , we don’t win very much .
you’re very smart , tough people .
you like to win .
right ?
this guy over here .
you like to win .
and we don’t win anymore .
we used to win .
we don’t win anymore .
well , we’re going to start winning again .
we’re going to start winning again .
so , second amendment protected .
common core .
we’re going to end common core .
we’re bringing your education _UNK_ .
it’s going to be _UNK_ .
i don’t know if you know or if you’ve heard me say we have the absolute worst – we spend number one in the world on education .
right ?
number one per _UNK_ in the world .
there is no second place because we’re so high , so much – you have china , you have _UNK_ , you have _UNK_ , you have _UNK_ .
you have these countries are the best in terms of education and they’re on the list the best .
and the 30th in the top 30 – we’re number 30th .
okay ?
we’re number one in costs .
that’s a little bit like what i’m doing .
i’m the least spent money .
you know , i’m funding my own campaign .
right ?
so , i don’t have a lot of the people coming to me .
you know , the drug companies and all of the – because if you would see the kind of waste , fraud , and corruption in the united states , a lot of it isn’t really waste , fraud , and corruption .
it’s the fact that people that are running against me and people in the senate , people in congress , they have tremendous power because they have people giving them _UNK_ campaign contributions and they’re special interests and they do what those people want .
and that’s one of the reasons why our budget is out of _UNK_ , the military is out of _UNK_ .
the military orders equipment they don’t even want and the stuff they do want they don’t get because the company that makes that equipment is like , you know , it’s not politically _UNK_ , and companies that really are , they make the _UNK_ we don’t want .
it’s going to all change because i’m not getting any money from all of these people .
i don’t give a _UNK_ .
i mean , we’re going to do the right thing .
we’re going to absolutely do the right thing .
i’ll tell you a little story .
so the drug companies .
we are the largest _UNK_ of drugs in the world , the united states ... which makes a lot of sense i guess .
but we purchase more drugs that make you better , drugs that make you better , not the kind of drugs that come over the southern border , which we’re going to end .
okay ?
we’re going to build a wall .
_UNK_ .
folks , by the way , we’re going to build a wall and who’s going to pay for the wall ?
[ audience : `` mexico '' ] you better believe it .
we have a trade deficit with mexico of $ _UNK_ billion .
and these _UNK_ come up , these politicians that i’m running against , `` you don’t really think mexico is going to pay for the wall ? ''
i said , `` absolutely , 100 % . ''
they said , `` how are you going to get mexico to pay ? ''
and i don’t want to get into it because they won’t understand it .
i mean , they have no concept of business .
they have no – you know , the $ 150 billion we gave to iran , these people have no concept .
we have a $ _UNK_ billion trade deficit with mexico .
okay ?
the wall is going to cost $ 12 billion .
maybe less .
if i build it , _UNK_ be _UNK_ , better , and less .
okay ?
so you think of this .
so you think of this .
so they said , `` how are you going to possibly do it ? ''
they make so much money .
plus we give them _UNK_ .
they make so much money from the united states it’s going to be one of the easiest things .
and i don’t know if you’ve heard , one of the presidents or _UNK_ of mexico held a news conference .
he said , `` we will never ever , ever pay for the wall . ''
and the press called me .
they said , `` they said they will never pay for the wall . ''
i said , `` who was it ? ''
_UNK_ .
he’s very nice , good guy .
i said , `` tell him the following .
the wall just got 10 feet higher . ''
i mean it .
it got 10 feet higher .
yeah , they’re going to pay for it .
and i get along great with mexico .
the problem is – i mean , they buy _UNK_ .
i have hundreds and hundreds and even thousands of workers are _UNK_ who i’m doing great with .
we have such an amazing relationship with _UNK_ and they’re great people .
the problem is the leaders of mexico are too smart for our leaders .
they’re too smart .
they’re too _UNK_ .
you look at what’s going on .
it’s _UNK_ .
the border is a disaster .
it’s a _UNK_ .
people flow over .
it’s not going to happen anymore , folks .
people can come into our country but they’re going to come in legally .
they’re going to come in through a process .
they’re going to come in , they’re going to come in legally .
so with trade , we’re going to solve the trade problem .
i don’t know if you saw carrier air _UNK_ announced two days ago they’re moving to mexico .
_UNK_ .
they’re moving their big plant from chicago to mexico .
ford , they’re moving this massive complex – they’re building a $ 2.5 billion plant and now they’ve just announced they’re building it bigger .
i’ve been talking about this for two years .
yesterday , the wall street _UNK_ , they announced they’re building it bigger .
in another words , they’re doubling down .
you know why ?
nobody does anything about it .
i’m going to do something about it .
so i watched – somebody asked , `` what would you do about carrier ? ''
because that was a _UNK_ case .
somebody used their cell phone and they were telling them , `` you’re out of work .
you’re out of job .
forget it .
it’s over .
we’re moving to mexico . ''
are _UNK_ .
grown men that have been there for a long time .
really incredible people .
and they’re _UNK_ and they’re devastated and they lost their job and they’ve never had another job and now this plant – this whole thing is moving to mexico .
and they said , `` what would you do ? ''
i said i’ll tell you what i’m going to do because you know they talk about free trade .
i’m a free _UNK_ .
but i say oh if i put a tax on these _UNK_ – these _UNK_ .
i mean , they’re like _UNK_ .
they say `` donald trump is not a true conservative because he taxes . ''
it’s got to be fair stuff , folks .
it’s got to be fair .
i’m a conservative person .
hey , i’m the most conservative on the border .
i’m the most conservative with the military .
_UNK_ tougher than me .
i’m the most conservative .
we are going to make our military so big , so strong , so powerful , _UNK_ ever going to mess with us , folks .
we won’t have to use it .
i’m the most conservative on taking care of the vets .
our vets are treated _UNK_ .
we’re going to take care of our – i’m the most conservative on common core .
we’re ending common core – i told you that – and we’re moving it _UNK_ .
and nobody is more conservative and we call _UNK_ but nobody is more conservative on the second amendment .
so all of these things .
but with carrier ... they’re coming across and they’re going to build a plant and probably get some subsidies from mexico – probably – we’ve probably given them subsidies .
they probably have the united states giving subsidies to move out of the country .
that’s how _UNK_ it is and that’s how _UNK_ we’re running ... they said , `` what would you do ? ''
i say it’s very easy .
we call them .
we say let’s have a meeting .
here’s the story folks .
you’re moving to mexico .
congratulations .
but if you don’t stay in the united states you’re going to have a problem .
but here’s what you do it .
you want to move to mexico , build your factory , it’s going to be wonderful .
hire your people they’re not from the united states .
all those people are now looking for jobs .
those are good jobs .
you know we’re hiring a lot of _UNK_ now ... the numbers are _UNK_ _UNK_ .
the 5 % – _UNK_ _UNK_ numbers .
so i say here’s what we’re going to do .
very simple .
you build your plant in mexico .
enjoy yourselves .
and you’re going to have air _UNK_ and just have them cross the border and sell them to the united states ?
no , you’re going to pay a 35 % tax on every air _UNK_ .
it’s true .
it’s the only thing you can do .
and you know what ?
it’s the only thing you can do .
there’s nothing else .
because otherwise how are you going to get them to stop ?
and then you have the _UNK_ with china .
the _UNK_ .
they’re like grand _UNK_ _UNK_ or grand – i mean these people are the greatest – the greatest in history .
they’re _UNK_ of that – _UNK_ .
they _UNK_ their currency .
japan is doing very well too .
they’re killing _UNK_ .
you know , they’re _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ now because they’ve _UNK_ – look , you take a look at what’s happened to the _UNK_ and it’s very hard .
a friend a mine .
he’s a big _UNK_ .
you all know _UNK_ .
i love _UNK_ .
this _UNK_ a very big one .
he _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ all the time and _UNK_ .
he just put in a big order for _UNK_ .
not that he wanted to .
he said , `` donald , they made it impossible for me not to buy .
they’ve _UNK_ the _UNK_ to such an extent – japan – that it made it , i mean , i owe it to my family , to my company , to myself .
i have no choice . ''
and he was like _UNK_ .
he wanted to buy _UNK_ ... well china is doing that times 100 , times 1,000 , and what they’re doing is the _UNK_ of their currency makes it impossible for people to compete .
we can’t allow that stuff to happen .
look , when we send stuff over to china , it doesn’t get in .
if it does get in , you have to pay a big tax .
you know , it’s not supposed to be that way .
you know , it’s supposed to be free trade .
it’s supposed to be they come we go , back and forth .
they _UNK_ their currency and on top of it , they make it impossible .
i have a friend who’s a great manufacturer .
he said it’s virtually impossible to get his goods and he makes better stuff than they do .
he can’t get his goods into china .
when he does get them in , there’s a tax to pay .
i have a friend who actually bought an _UNK_ and he can’t get it into china because the tax is so massive .
he’s going to sell it now at a big loss .
okay ?
and think about _UNK_ .
okay ?
think about _UNK_ .
_UNK_ is building a plant over here .
_UNK_ just had a big order from china .
but china is making them build a massive _UNK_ facility .
right ?
massive .
like bigger than anything you’ve seen .
okay , you feel good about _UNK_ right now .
tell me in five years .
unless i’m president .
you’ll be fine .
don’t worry about it .
but tell me in five years you’re going to feel good about _UNK_ because i’ll tell you what’s happening .
they are going to build that plant – they’re building it , it’s going to be finished soon – they’re going to build that plant , they’re going to _UNK_ the hell out of their currency , and all of a sudden you’ll be reading a big front page story all over the place that _UNK_ is going to leave , right , south carolina , they’re going to make all their planes in china .
because this is what they do .
that’s what they do .
and our leaders aren’t smart enough to stop it , okay ?
i have carl _UNK_ _UNK_ me .
great _UNK_ , very rich guy , very , very successful .
if i told carl , carl , watch over china trade , we’re going to be in great shape .
we have right now people that have no concept of what they’re doing .
they have no concept of what they’re doing .
they’re political _UNK_ .
that’s what they are .
they’re political _UNK_ and these are the people that are negotiating with these people china .
and again , china likewise , i get along great with china .
largest bank in the world my _UNK_ .
they buy _UNK_ for tens of millions of dollars .
i have the bank of america building in california .
i own a big chunk of that .
i got that through china through a very complex set of transactions but through china .
i mean , i think china is terrific .
i’m not angry at china .
i’m angry at our leaders for not being able to compete with china .
i’m not angry .
so we’re going to get things changed around .
we’re going to use our best people .
we’re going to be so smart , and we’re going to start winning again .
we’re going to have strong borders .
we’re going to have strong military .
we’re going to take care of our vets .
we’re going to have such great trade deals .
we’re going to win again .
we’re going to win again .
we’re going to win so much .
and you know , and by the way , we are going to get rid of isis and we’re going to get rid of them fast .
i was against the war in iraq from the beginning .
i was against the war in iraq .
we shouldn’t have done it .
we did it .
then obama got out the wrong way .
we shouldn’t have done iraq .
we did it .
it _UNK_ the middle east .
exactly .
if you go back , you could see 2003 , _UNK_ , i said it’s going to _UNK_ _UNK_ the middle east because you had iran and iraq and they were the same _UNK_ .
they’d fight , fight , fight .
boom .
then they’d rest .
then they’d fight , fight , fight for years and years and years .
we _UNK_ iraq and now iran is taking over .
not only do they get the $ 150 billion .
maybe the worst _UNK_ i’ve ever seen negotiated .
no , no , don’t buy the famous obama administration .
the worst , one of the _UNK_ deals i’ve ever seen .
i mean , we get nothing .
we get nothing .
we should have gotten those _UNK_ before we started even negotiating .
not now .
we should have gotten them years ago .
but if you look at what’s going on and now on top of that we gave them iraq because iran is now taking over iraq .
it’s just taking them over .
so here’s what we did .
we spent $ 2 trillion , thousands of lives lost , wounded warriors who we all love all over the place .
they’re the best people .
most incredible .
they’re tougher than all of us these people .
i mean , what they’ve gone through .
so the wounded warriors all over the place .
you know what we have ?
we have nothing .
we have nothing .
we have absolutely nothing .
so here’s what we’re going to do .
we’re going to change things around .
we’re going to be smart .
and we have – we’ll do what we have to do in terms of isis and all .
but we have to start rebuilding our country .
we have $ 4 trillion in the various places .
$ 4 trillion .
not going to happen anymore .
we’re going to have a strong military .
but we’re going to have to rebuild our roads , our bridges , our _UNK_ , our schools , our hospitals .
i mean , our country is like a third world country .
you go over to _UNK_ , you go over to some of these places in the middle east .
you go to china .
you see the airports .
you see the bridges .
they have bridges that are so incredible you’ve never seen anything like it .
they have railroad trains that go _UNK_ miles an hour and we have things that go _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ like from 100 years ago .
we’ve become like a third world nation because we’re fighting everybody else’s battles .
and remember this , we are like the _UNK_ of the world but we don’t get paid anything .
we protect germany .
we protect japan .
do you know that in japan if we get attacked , we have a treaty with japan , if we get attacked they don’t have to do anything .
if they get attacked , we have world war _UNK_ , we have to protect them .
okay ?
i mean , who makes these deals ?
we protect as an example south korea , who have a _UNK_ right next to them .
right ?
but we protect south korea .
so every time we order _UNK_ , they come from south korea , they make a fortune .
we protect south korea .
let me tell you something .
why aren’t they paying ?
they pay _UNK_ for what we do .
every time this guy , you know , raises his head , we see our ships start to _UNK_ , our soldiers get ready .
we have _UNK_ soldiers at the border .
so we take care of the world .
we don’t get it .
saudi arabia , before the oil went down , they were making $ 1 billion a day .
$ 1 billion a day .
and we _UNK_ space there so we can help them .
we _UNK_ military bases .
we pay _UNK_ .
and yet without us they wouldn’t last for two weeks .
they’d be gone .
so we’re going to change all that stuff folks .
i mean , i want to be good .
we want to be fair .
we want to have heart .
and we’re not going to let these syrian folks in that we don’t know who they are .
we don’t know where they come from .
they’re not coming into this country .
they’re not coming in .
i mean , there are a lot of them .
i don’t know if you know it .
you have a lot of them moving into south carolina .
i don’t know .
have you heard this ?
and you ought to tell your governor don’t let them move to south carolina .
you don’t want them in south carolina .
and i know they’ll say , `` well , we have nothing to do .
we’re state government . ''
let me tell you something .
if a governor from a state didn’t want to have them , i don’t care what it says , you don’t have to have them ... we want to help them with safe _UNK_ .
we want to get the gulf states to pay .
i don’t want to pay .
we owe $ 19 trillion .
we owe enough .
we can lead it but let the gulf states – they have so much money they don’t know what to do with it .
let them build safe _UNK_ .
look at what’s happening in germany .
it’s a mess .
look at _UNK_ .
look at _UNK_ .
i mean , _UNK_ , you go there 20 years ago , 15 years ago it was incredible .
so when i call for _UNK_ and i call for this , first i get hit with tremendous heat .
right ?
then everybody starts to say , `` you know , he’s right . ''
same thing – on june _UNK_ , i announced we’ve got to stop illegal immigration .
the heat i took was _UNK_ .
three , four weeks later they’re all saying , you know , trump is right .
then _UNK_ killed in san _UNK_ , beautiful _UNK_ , by an illegal immigrant .
you have _UNK_ in los _UNK_ killed .
incredible guy .
young man .
the _UNK_ a friend of mine – a great guy .
you had the veteran – _UNK_ woman – a veteran _UNK_ , _UNK_ , and killed in los _UNK_ by an illegal immigrant .
we’ve got to stop it folks .
we’ve got to stop it .
we’ve got to be smart .
we’ve got to be a country again .
we’ve got to be a country again .
so i just want to thank – this _UNK_ meant so much to me from these two guys and from the whole community .
i just want to say get out and vote .
we’re going to do something you’re going to be so happy with .
we’re going to win so much and we’re going to make america great again .
that’s what we want to do .
make america great again .
so saturday , get out and vote .
thank you !
we love you all .
thank you very much !
thank you .
thank you very much folks .
i don’t really think – look , what happened is we had 17 candidates originally .
i was expected to come in like anywhere maybe 10 , 11 , 12 , _UNK_ i ended up coming in second .
didn’t devote tremendous time to it .
didn’t devote tremendous money to it .
in fact , i guess in terms of money per vote , i’m about at the bottom , meaning the most efficient .
i came in second .
i came into strong second .
third , i think , was quite a bit away – i think 2,500 or something – close to 3,000 votes away .
there’s a big difference between second and third .
i think we did really well .
you know , as far as that’s concerned .
i think the press – some of the press said i did _UNK_ well .
some of the press doesn’t want to give it credit .
i think we did very well .
i didn’t expect to do so well .
i guess what did happen is one poll came out and said i’m 4 or 5 points ahead and that maybe build up a false expectation for some people .
but it had taken me back to june _UNK_ .
i was told `` don’t even go to iowa .
start right here in new hampshire .
just don’t waste your – `` ... i’m going to iowa .
i went .
i _UNK_ with the people , _UNK_ with _UNK_ .
we did really _UNK_ and came very close to winning .
i mean , we came very close to winning .
we came in second place .
so i am very happy with what happened in iowa .
you know , you had 17 people and i was second .
now , i guess you have 11 people and i was second .
and i think we did a very good job .
no , i don’t think i feel any pressure .
i mean , we’re going to just do what i have to do .
and if it works out , that’s great .
and if it doesn’t , that’s okay too because you know i’m here to do one thing – the _UNK_ – make america great again .
i’m going to do it .
and i think we did very well – i think we did really well in just about everything we’ve done running for office .
i think we have a very good result yesterday .
it could have been a little bit better .
it could have been one _UNK_ better .
but it’s interesting all of these governors and senators that you have way down the list , they’re at 1 % , 2 % , you know , in terms of what happened – what just happened – they’re at 1 % , they’re at 2 % , they’re 3 % .
nobody ever talks about them .
and i’m at 24 % or 25 % , and they say , `` oh , couldn’t you have done better ? ''
you know , i think the result was quite good especially for the amount of time i spent and for the amount of money i spent .
well , i think i have – i think it fits me better , probably _UNK_ me better .
i’ve done very well in new hampshire .
i’ve been here a lot more .
i have very good relationships with the people of new hampshire .
but i’ve had very good relationships with pretty much everybody .
i really don’t .
i really don’t see that happening .
i don’t know what’s going to happen .
you don’t – nobody does .
we’ll see what – you’ll have many , many people that aren’t doing very well .
i am doing very well .
but you have many , many people that are here , that are _UNK_ politicians – they’re governors and they’re senators – but they’re not doing very well .
and they just came back from a , you know , very major defeat yesterday .
and mine wasn’t .
... you know , it’s very interesting .
if you look at the numbers from yesterday , i got the highest number in history outside the one number – in the history of the primary .
... also , i guess they had _UNK_ people , which is _UNK_ or 50,000 people more than they ever had .
no , i mean , i think we’ll get a lot of _UNK_ voters .
you know , they’re very much into the trade world and i’m the best on trade .
he _UNK_ it but i don’t think he’s going to be capable of doing anything about it .
no , i think we’re going to do really well here .
i look forward to it .
we have a lot of events _UNK_ , yes .
well , we do .
we have one commitment long-term for _UNK_ actually where we’re going to have about 10,000 people .
but we’re going to be back and forth very quickly .
we’re going to have a lot of events _UNK_ , yes .
well , i just think , you know , i’m just happy with the way we’re doing .
you know , we’ve _UNK_ with the people whether it’s there or here .
i mean , there’s just a big _UNK_ process going on .
if you look at south carolina , it’s the same thing .
i mean , we’re doing really well there .
but we’ve devoted much more time here and south carolina – it’s not a question of learning .
i mean , i just want to continue to do well ... our _UNK_ – the _UNK_ is so important .
it’s just make america great again .
that’s what we’re going to do .
that’s what we’re going to do .
not really a question of learning .
well , if you look at the second place , people didn’t talk about my second place .
they didn’t talk about it as _UNK_ as they should have .
and yet , with _UNK_ who was more than 2,000 votes behind me – that’s a lot of votes by the way – they said , `` oh , he’s _UNK_ .
he’s _UNK_ . ''
so , i don’t know why is the third place person doing well and the second place person , who by the way has never run – scott was _UNK_ before – `` one of the amazing things about you , you’ve never run for office before .
it’s incredible how you did . ''
my _UNK_ doing great .
yeah .
no , i think just work .
we’re going to work very hard and we have a lot of meetings , a lot of talks , a lot of speeches .
we’re going to be meeting with a lot of people and i think we’re going to do very well .
well , we’ll be doing some of that but we also have some very big events planned like tonight , i think they have _UNK_ or 5,000 people and other people were here yesterday and they had 200 people .
same _UNK_ , same everything .
they had 200 people .
so we have – there’s a good _UNK_ going on .
well , i enjoyed it .
i have unlimited , i have unlimited – you know , it’s funny .
when i look at the various people , they said so and so has $ 20 million .
i have unlimited .
that’s not the thing .
the only – you know , i’m a _UNK_ .
i want to spend wisely .
and i’m probably $ 40 million under budget because of the fact that frankly i haven’t had to spend very much although i guess we just did a recent _UNK_ and i would be probably having spent now maybe $ 14 million , $ 15 million .
but i’m _UNK_ .
and i must tell you , i don’t know that enough people appreciate it .
i’m _UNK_ anyway whether they appreciate it or not .
so i won’t be _UNK_ by the _UNK_ and you know _UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ .
but i don’t know – i was talking to scott about this before – i don’t know it’s really _UNK_ by the voters .
i’m the only one on both sides that’s _UNK_ funding .
i’m putting up my own money .
and i don’t know that the voters appreciate it .
when they go into vote , i don’t think they say `` i’m going to vote for trump because he’s _UNK_ and he’s not going to be _UNK_ by _UNK_ and special interests _UNK_ _UNK_ . ''
i’m going to tell them and i tell them .
but sometimes they like it but i don’t think it’s something they vote for , which is a shame because it’s actually a very big thing .
you understand that .
it’s a very big thing .
it’s a very big element if you could have somebody that can actually _UNK_ and not be _UNK_ by bad decisions ... or looking for themselves or looking for the company or country they represent .
that’s a real positive ... i just don’t know whether or not the voters appreciate it .
i’ve learned that they’re great people .
i really , i thought the people in iowa were _UNK_ ... you know , obviously i was second .
i had the largest vote getting in the history of a republican primary except for one and i brought many of those extra people in .
and they also had as you know the largest _UNK_ in the history of republican _UNK_ in terms of iowa by far – not even close .
i think it was like 50,000 or _UNK_ more than they’ve ever had before .
so i just – i learned that they are terrific people in iowa .
yeah , i look forward to it .
... no , i don’t think so .
i have a very good relationship with _UNK_ .
i like him ... i don’t see that necessarily .
you’re talking about iowa ?
well , that could have been with the debate .
i think it could have been the debate .
i think some people were _UNK_ that i didn’t go in the debate .
if i had to do it again , i would have done the _UNK_ same thing .
and the reason is – you know why ?
because i raised $ 6 million for the vets in one hour .
so if i took a second place instead of a first place and could give the vets $ 6 million , i’ll do that all day long .
well , we’re going to be spending money .
we’re going to be spending money – we’re going to be spending a lot of money .
we’ll be spending money on ads and we’ll be spending money on the ground game .
i can’t help it , _UNK_ , whether i’m celebrity .
i mean , this is me .
look , i think most people say i did a great job in iowa .
i came in second .
i spent far less than anybody else .
and had i known that i was going to be liked as much as i am in iowa and people did like me – you will understand that – i would have maybe spent a little bit more and i would have been there a little bit more and maybe i would have won it .
but , you know , i’m very happy with it .
i have 7 delegates right at the top .
you look at other people in all fairness – senators , governors – they’re , you know , they’re way down .
when i have 25 % or 26 % and they have 1 % but you people don’t mention that .
but the one thing is you people don’t mention that .
you don’t mention all the other names .
now , you mention the person , _UNK_ , good guy .
but he came in third .
and they make it sound like he had a victory and i didn’t .
but i came in second .
... i started off on _UNK_ .
i was _UNK_ .
when i first started , i had nothing .
and then i _UNK_ my way up – went pretty rapidly actually .
and now i’m leading everything and i did okay in iowa .
pretty good in iowa .
well , i think we’re going to have great success here .
i think it’s a much different kind of a process .
this isn’t a _UNK_ process .
this is a much different – this is a normal voting process .
the iowa is a much different kind of a thing .
well , he [ _UNK_ to ted cruz ] _UNK_ me .
i mean , he started with the _UNK_ , as you know .
and he _UNK_ ben _UNK_ by doing what he did to ben _UNK_ .
that was a _UNK_ .
and he _UNK_ the people of iowa by doing a voter violation form that _UNK_ ever seen before which was _UNK_ .
no , no , he’s a man of insult .
no , i’m going .
i have thousands of people going .
no , but we don’t have that invite .
i like mike _UNK_ but no , i don’t think he’s even going to be there .
i did .
i did .
no , i like him .
well , he’s left the race so i feel pretty good about that .
he’s a good man .
well , we’re adding some and we’re adding them pretty rapidly .
... people in your world are saying they possibly could .
so i don’t really see one or two .
i see there could be a number .
i’d love to finish first .
you know , again it would still not be _UNK_ because you’re competing against a lot of very talented people that have been politicians all their lives .
i have been a politician for 6 months .
no , but i’d love to finish first .
wouldn’t _UNK_ but you know it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world .
i could think of worse things .
but i’d like to finish first .
i think we will finish first .
i’d like to finish first .
... just so you understand .
i am _UNK_ _UNK_ my campaign other than small _UNK_ because people send in small _UNK_ for $ 10 , $ 15 , $ 20 ... no , no , that’s _UNK_ sales .
that’s a lot of _UNK_ sales .
it’s a small amount of money compared to what i put in .
it’s very hard when somebody sends you a check for $ _UNK_ and $ 9 and $ 200 , very hard to send that back .
i am .
and i always make the _UNK_ .
i always make a _UNK_ to that and i do it every time .
well , he’s [ _UNK_ to scott brown ] somebody that i respect , always liked .
and he’s very , very respected throughout the country but he’s very respected here .
and everybody wanted his _UNK_ and i’m very honored that he’s giving it to me and he’s going to give it to me on the stage .
that happens with _UNK_ .
no , that happens with _UNK_ .
it’s pretty common with _UNK_ .
... a poll came out a few days before that said i was about 5 points so maybe there was a _UNK_ .
and again , it may have been the debate , which would have set records if i did it .
so i would have liked that .
but the fact is it could have been the debate .
maybe it is .
maybe it isn’t .
but i would have done it exactly the same way because i raised , scott , we raised in one hour , i raised $ 6 million for the vets .
and i would never , ever give that up to go between first and second in iowa .
wouldn’t be worth it .
i think her _UNK_ situation is very serious .
i have a feeling she’s being protected by the democrats because it just looks to me to be more serious than anybody that i’ve seen including _UNK_ petraeus .
if you watch and study and read about various lawyers – you know , that’s what they do – they really feel she’s in grave danger and what she’s done is against the law not just against rules .
it’s against the law .
i just don’t know what’s going to happen because i don’t know whether or not the democrats are going to protect her .
i never saw a race where they’re _UNK_ _UNK_ .
i mean , they’re _UNK_ _UNK_ .
what kind of a race is that ?
it’s _UNK_ .
i thought it was terrible .
i mean , you call it a tie .
but to _UNK_ _UNK_ , they say `` okay , you’re going to get this district .
we’re going to _UNK_ a _UNK_ . ''
i don’t know .
i can’t tell you yet .
i think he’s [ _UNK_ to ted cruz ] certainly was dirty what he did to ben _UNK_ was terrible .
he did the voter violation form .
i thought that was terrible .
actually , i thought it was terrible .
and when they said that ben _UNK_ was out of the race and come vote for him , i thought that was terrible .
okay ?
thank you everybody .
thank you .
thank you .
_UNK_ , what a crowd .
thank you very much everybody .
such an honor .
with the snow coming down and it’s a little cold outside and you have hundreds of people still outside trying to get in .
but you know , we won’t wait .
we’ll go ahead .
right ?
we’ll go ahead .
first of all , congratulations to the iowa state basketball team .
you had a – what was that all about ?
i turned on the game .
i said , `` _UNK_ , this shouldn’t be that good of a game . ''
and at the end of the game , i said , `` who won ? ''
yes ?
that was great and it’s a great achievement .
i also want to pay my respects to ben _UNK_ .
they had a really bad accident .
some of his _UNK_ were hurt really bad .
so i just want to pay my respects to ben .
he’s a good guy – a really good guy – and his _UNK_ and hopefully they get better .
say a prayer for them .
okay ?
we’ve had an amazing time today .
we’ve been all over iowa and we’re going to be here tomorrow .
we’re going to be here so much you’re going to get so sick of me .
you’re going to say , `` please , tell him to get out of here .
tell him to leave .
tell him to go . ''
but we’ve had an incredible time .
and you know it started really – we’ve had really a pretty good week .
the debate last week – everybody watched the debate .
and who knew about these debates ?
i didn’t know anything about the debates .
and it’s been fun and it’s been interesting .
and i’ve been treated _UNK_ by the _UNK_ .
not 100 % .
some have been very fair actually , and some have been not so fair .
and you know , a lot of the press hasn’t been very fair .
boy , look at the press back there .
they must think there’s a big event going happen today .
_UNK_ , that’s a lot of them – it’s like the academy _UNK_ .
but we’ve had an amazing – it’s been an amazing experience and it started really on june _UNK_ when we came down the _UNK_ .
we came down that _UNK_ and it was – i said , `` let’s go '' to my wife , who’s been so supportive and so wonderful .
i said , `` let’s go .
we’re going to make america great again .
that’s what we’re going to do . ''
and you know , it’s hard to do this because when you think of it i’ve never done it before .
i’ve never been a politician .
thank goodness but i’ve never been a politician .
i’ve always done jobs and put a lot of people to work .
tens of thousands of people over the years .
and you know , i have thousands of _UNK_ that love me .
the nevada poll just came out where i’m leading with _UNK_ , which i knew , i knew .
and we came out at that particular opening when i opened and said i’m going to run for president i gave up a lot .
you know , gave up a lot of different things including telling our friends at _UNK_ no more _UNK_ .
that’s hard to do .
you have a top show and you say , `` i’m not doing it anymore .
i’m sorry . ''
they wanted to do it so badly .
and steve _UNK_ , who’s a _UNK_ executive , came up to my office and said `` come on , donald .
come on .
do it .
you’re not going to run .
do it .
do it . ''
i said , `` steve , i’m going to run . ''
i was pretty sure .
you know , that was about two months before .
i was pretty sure .
it really is a tough thing to do .
you know , all my life i’ve heard `` if you’re a very successful person , you’ll never run for president .
you’ll never really run for politics .
but you’ll never ever run for president . ''
and i built a great company and it’s a tremendous number .
you saw the _UNK_ .
the press was going to look so closely .
it was like d-day when we put those papers in .
you know , first thing i did i announced .
they said , `` oh , he’s actually going to do it '' because most of them said `` he’ll never do it . ''
then when i signed ... that’s when you sign your life away .
and i signed that .
they said , `` _UNK_ !
he signed that .
well , he’ll never file his _UNK_ because maybe he’s not as rich as everybody thinks . ''
and i _UNK_ the _UNK_ and they saw an _UNK_ – you didn’t hear a thing about it .
oh boy , were they looking .
i mean , were they looking .
and almost 100 pages .
the biggest report ever _UNK_ with the _UNK_ in terms of that .
and it showed a company that’s a _UNK_ company with some of the great assets , very little debt , tremendous cash flow .
you know , the way it’s supposed to be .
and it’s great .
and the reason i tell you that is because that is the kind of thinking we need now in the united states .
we need that kind of thinking .
we need that – whatever it is .
we need a _UNK_ that’s going to – you know , we’re at $ 19 trillion in debt .
it’s going to be up to $ _UNK_ trillion .
you saw that _UNK_ budget .
_UNK_ , _UNK_ budget that was approved two weeks ago and that’s going to lift it .
and so we went along and a lot of things have happened and then the polls came out which i love and new ones came out today and i’ll tell you right now .
you know , now that we’re at it .
and they came out some brand new ones – some _UNK_ .
and one’s coming out – i guess a big one’s coming out .
i don’t know exactly what it is but it’s got to be pretty good because i see the response .
i mean , even this with all the people still trying to come into this building .
somebody said it’s a _UNK_ .
this is a very nice _UNK_ actually .
but with all of the people still trying to come in , you see what it is .
and we do have something special in a couple of minutes .
to me , it’s really special because it’s a person that i think is a _UNK_ person .
so it’s very special to me .
but then the polls came out and some of them – as an example – national polls _UNK_ % for trump , 20 % for second .
i wouldn’t even names .
right ?
i won’t even mention names .
i’m going to be _UNK_ today for a change .
_UNK_ % for the second .
11 % .
and then they’re all down .
some of them are actually at _UNK_ % and 1 % .
i don’t know .
_UNK_ – well , you know , _UNK_ got one problem .
he loves common core , meaning he wants your kids educated from washington , which is immediately no good .
and his second problem is he’s very weak on illegal immigration .
remember , he said they come as an act of love .
i said , `` what ?
they come as an act of love ? ''
so i think those are two very bad points frankly .
... so south carolina just came out and that’s _UNK_ % for trump , 18 % for second , 11 % for third .
great .
florida leading by a lot – 31 % , 19 % , 13 % , and then all down in the _UNK_ .
georgia just came out .
i have 33 % .
yeah , don’t forget that’s 33 % .
hard to believe .
that’s with 14 people , 15 people .
i don’t know when they took it but it was recent .
33 % .
connecticut – now , tom _UNK_ loves me and that’s sort of like , you know , and i love tom _UNK_ by the way .
35 % to 18 % to 9 % to 2 % .
you know , to nothing .
maryland just came out .
maryland – great place – _UNK_ % to 15 % to 11 % to 9 % and then you know they sort of phase out .
you ever hear of a place called iowa ?
oh , i love this .
we’re doing actually great .
first of all , i have to tell you .
you know , they never report it .
even cnn doesn’t report it .
cnn does a poll , probably spent millions , they never report their poll .
the cnn poll was 33 % for trump , 20 % for chris .
nobody talks about it .
nobody talks about it .
they don’t talk about it .
they talk about – cnn is reporting other people’s polls .
so , i call up .
i say , `` wait a minute .
you’re cnn .
you spent a fortune on polls and you don’t report your own polls because i’m winning by a lot . ''
and they have no excuse but they keep reporting other polls .
but we’re doing well .
i think we’re doing a lot better than anyone knows .
_UNK_ just came out – _UNK_ % for trump , _UNK_ % for cruz .
_UNK_ _UNK_ % for trump , 26 % for cruz .
in other words , it’s a little close here .
_UNK_ poll – very respected 31 % for trump , 29 % for cruz .
and then again cnn 33 % to 20 % .
so we’re – i think we’re doing good .
i think we’re actually doing better than the polls .
now , i could do this .
i could say , `` well , i just want to do well in iowa . ''
i want to win iowa , folks .
because look , i love the people .
the _UNK_ have been _UNK_ .
i’m doing great with the _UNK_ but nationwide i’m winning with _UNK_ – i don’t know if you know that – by a lot nationwide .
with iowa , i’m doing really well with the _UNK_ .
we’re doing really well with the tea party .
we’re doing well – i mean , you hear the numbers .
i mean , these are the numbers .
but i actually think we’re doing even better than the polls .
and you know , there’s the thing that a lot of people said , you know , they call up , `` are you going to vote for trump ?
he’s got very , very tough immigration policies .
he wants to destroy obamacare and replace it with something a lot better . ''
i’m going to do that .
okay ?
but you know , a lot of people , they’ll pick up the phone and they’ll hear different things and they’ll say , `` _UNK_ , no i’ll vote for – `` and then they’d get in the _UNK_ and they say , `` trump is my man . ''
there are a lot of people saying that we’re going to do a lot better .
but we’ll see because _UNK_ 1st you have to get to caucus , you have to go out .
you’ve got to do it .
otherwise , we’ve all wasted our time .
you know , one of the groups in _UNK_ and it was like incredible .
we were in different places up in new _UNK_ recently and new hampshire was amazing .
and the people are standing there .
it was so cold .
there was one little group of – despite global warming – you know , you hear about `` it was so cold . ''
it was _UNK_ below zero .
and people were standing outside for hours trying to get in .
and then you hear the _UNK_ .
`` well , will they show up to vote ? ''
and i don’t know much but i say like if people are going to stand out for four hours in the cold or the heat because believe me they stood out in the heat during the summer and during the fall like you wouldn’t believe in tennessee , in texas where we had _UNK_ people , no matter where we go we have these big crowds but they’ll stand for hours and hours to get in .
why aren’t they going to go and vote ?
or in your case caucus ?
why aren’t they going to go and vote ?
it’s sort of an amazing thing .
so we think they’re going to really be – why would somebody wait for hours for four hours and not going to take two minutes to vote ?
now , yours is a little more complicated because the caucus system is a little bit different .
it’s a very interesting system .
but it is different .
here’s what i have to say about iowa .
it’s very important .
so you know there’s a movement to move iowa to the back of the _UNK_ .
okay ?
you know that .
you’ll still see me but you won’t see other people .
believe me .
i’m loyal .
to a fault i’m loyal .
but you’re going to see .
i give you my word .
i win ; they’re not _UNK_ iowa .
this is an amazing tradition .
no , seriously .
this is an amazing tradition .
they’re not moving iowa back .
and they’re not moving new hampshire either because they’re talking about iowa , new hampshire .
they’re not _UNK_ new hampshire .
so , we’re going to just keep it the way it is .
it really is .
it’s an amazing .
first of all , you’re amazing people .
but all over the country it’s a movement all over the country .
the people are incredible .
they want to make america great again .
they’re going to do something that’s special .
and you know we used to talk silent majority ?
i say it’s the noisy majority because it’s actually a noisy majority .
it’s not a silent majority .
but people are fed up .
so i started on june _UNK_ and we did well .
_UNK_ from the beginning we went up .
and if you remember , we started at nothing .
you know , we started at nothing because nobody believed i was going to [ run ] .
even when they – my wife said , `` you know if you run , you’re going to win . ''
i said , `` what do you mean ? ''
she said , `` people don’t believe you’re going to run . ''
at the polls .
i was getting these little polls .
i felt like some of these guys now that are senators and governors ; they get these little polls .
... _UNK_ again , right ?
boy , he’s taking a lot of abuse .
you know ?
i told him `` you know what ?
you should use the name bush .
what’s wrong ?
use the name bush .
i mean , maybe it’s not working but it’s better than _UNK_ right ? ''
you know , i really do .
get rid of the _UNK_ point and just put _UNK_ bush .
it’s your name .
don’t be _UNK_ of your name .
so _UNK_ , i wish him the best .
but , you know , i started and i started at like 2 % or 3 % and then it went to 6 % and then it went to 9 % .
and each time the pundits – these real _UNK_ back here – some of them are sitting back here – these real _UNK_ like george will with the little _UNK_ – take away the _UNK_ .
he looks like a dumb guy , i’m telling you .
but each time these _UNK_ would say , `` well , he’s reached his _UNK_ .
he’s _UNK_ '' at 6 % , right ?
then it goes to 11 % .
`` well , you know , this is surprising but he’s reached his _UNK_ . ''
and then it goes to 18 % .
and then it went to 22 % , 24 % , _UNK_ % , then it went to _UNK_ % .
then it went actually _UNK_ % in the _UNK_ poll and in _UNK_ we got to _UNK_ % and even a little above that .
and then all of a sudden you didn’t hear so much about the _UNK_ .
i want to _UNK_ at _UNK_ % .
you know , _UNK_ % with like 14 people that’s pretty good .
but they kept saying , `` he’s _UNK_ .
that’s all he’ll get .
he’s got these _UNK_ . ''
we have the _UNK_ _UNK_ there are .
number one , we have the _UNK_ .
and the hardest working _UNK_ .
we have people that love the country more than anybody and they want to take back what’s happened because our country is going to hell .
we can be nice about it .
we can say it nice and _UNK_ .
our country is going to hell .
when you look at this _UNK_ iran deal where we’re paying $ 150 billion and they give us the five back but they don’t know where the fifth is and you understand what that means .
that’s not a good sign .
but they give us five people but they get seven and they get 14 off the _UNK_ .
these are bad _UNK_ .
they get 14 plus seven so they’re getting _UNK_ people .
and they have the right to do whatever they want from an enterprise _UNK_ .
right to do oil .
right to do whatever they want .
but what do they also get out of that deal ?
first of all , they’re going to get nuclear .
they don’t have to develop nuclear missiles .
they can buy them .
for the kind of money we gave them , they’re going to buy them .
why are they going to develop ?
remember the deal ?
24 days .
they have 24 days for _UNK_ period .
they also have _UNK_ .
right ?
but we paid $ 150 billion .
and i always say , `` _UNK_ .
what a great – the _UNK_ are great negotiators . ''
i say what a great deal that is .
... two weeks ago i started .
i said , `` wait a minute .
that’s not a good deal compared to the other deal . ''
they took over iraq .
we gave them iraq .
we knocked the hell out of iraq .
we _UNK_ their armed forces .
and you know , for years , they would fight .
for many , many years , for decades they’d fight , fight , fight .
nobody would win .
fight .
they’d rest .
then they’d go back to fight .
and now , we gave them the second largest oil reserves in the world , which is iraq .
we gave it to them .
now , they’re going into yemen .
and if you look at yemen , take a look .
they’re going to get syria .
they’re going to get yemen .
unless , you know , trust me a lot of good things are going to happen if i get in .
but let’s just sort of leave it the way it is .
they get syria .
they get yemen .
now , they didn’t want yemen .
but did you ever see the border between yemen and saudi arabia ?
they want saudi arabia .
so , what are they going to have ?
they’re going to have iraq .
they’re going to have iran .
they’re going to have iraq .
they’re going to have yemen .
they’re going to have syria .
they’re going to have everything .
they’re going to be a _UNK_ .
we’ve created this .
we have _UNK_ leadership .
really _UNK_ leadership .
so when i started , i said we have to do something about it .
it’s not something i wanted to do .
it’s something we have to do .
because i’m _UNK_ you .
i’m not taking any money .
i’m not , you know , like some of these guys where they’re getting millions and millions of dollars from people i know and they’re nice people and some are very bad people but they have no interest in the country .
they have interests in their company or they have interests in countries they’re _UNK_ .
and these people and these politicians are going to do exactly as they’re told by their lobbyists , their special interests , and their _UNK_ .
me , i’m going to do the right thing .
and i always tell the story .
when ford moves to mexico , i’m going to talk them out of it .
when _UNK_ moves its plant from chicago to mexico , i’m going to talk them out of it .
believe me .
it’s going to be easy .
it’s going to be easy .
so , i started and i talked about the border .
very strong on immigration and illegal immigration .
took a lot of heat .
but you wouldn’t even be talking about that subject if i didn’t bring it up .
and i talked about again i talked about isis and i talked about .
but what really happened is after paris we had _UNK_ people killed .
and by the way , i told you common core is dead and second amendment is right this way .
we’re going to protect the second amendment .
we’re going to protect the guns .
we’re going to protect your guns .
you know , if in paris and if in los _UNK_ , we had the two _UNK_ that were married .
she came on a _UNK_ permit ... you know , wonderful _UNK_ .
she was _UNK_ radicalized .
maybe radicalized him .
maybe he was already that way .
but we’ve got to start thinking .
we have to start using our head .
bad stuff is happening .
we have to find out what’s going on .
we have a president who won’t even talk about the term .
if you think , he won’t even mention anything to do with what we all know is going on .
and you can’t solve the problem if you don’t talk about it .
you have to talk about it .
so , very , very strongly we started talking about that .
and then after paris – and by the way , if we had a couple of you and you and you and you , if we had three or four people in that room in paris as an example where they have the toughest gun laws like in the world .
you can’t have a gun unless you’re bad guy , you bought a gun .
and they walked in just said `` boom !
boom !
boom !
you , move over .
boom ! ''
killed _UNK_ , more to follow because there are people that are so badly wounded .
but if we had a couple of – few of the people that i pointed out – i could plenty in this audience , believe me .
but if they had guns on their _UNK_ , if they had guns around their _UNK_ where the bullets went the opposite direction , it would have been a whole different story , folks .
_UNK_ be a whole different story .
so very , very big on the second amendment .
but what happened is all of a sudden after paris and to an extent , to a pretty big extent in california , what happened is these polls started coming in where everybody liked trump even more .
i went up 11 points .
i don’t want to do it for that reason .
but it went up because people want strength just like having the family of john _UNK_ , who was great .
i love john _UNK_ .
from iowa .
but out of nowhere i got the most beautiful letter from his daughter , who you just met , who’s an incredible woman , and she said , `` we’d like to _UNK_ you . ''
john _UNK_ was a strong guy .
we need strength .
we need strength in this country because we’re _UNK_ away with political _UNK_ _UNK_ .
okay ?
_UNK_ .
i mean , if you think of it , you can’t say `` _UNK_ christmas '' anymore .
we’re going to say `` _UNK_ christmas '' again .
you go into these department stores .
they don’t have any christmas _UNK_ .
they don’t have the sign `` _UNK_ christmas '' .
even people that aren’t christian are saying `` _UNK_ christmas .
we love christmas .
let us say _UNK_ _UNK_ , happy holidays . ''
but people like to see it .
and stores don’t put it up anymore .
we’re _UNK_ away .
we’re going in the wrong direction .
so i said we’re going to do this and i had no idea it was going to work this way .
i figured i’d be in the _UNK_ and maybe like a race horse .
you know , just at the end you can sort of inch it out .
i had no idea to have _UNK_ point leads _UNK_ .
we’re up by so much .
and you know , i want to keep it that way .
i want to keep it that way .
when you think – and just one thing before i introduce our incredible person , our incredible guest .
but one thing – i’ve spent to this point almost nothing and i’m in first place by a lot .
i tell this story .
i’m not _UNK_ about spending .
i’m just saying i’m telling the story .
i have spent – they’ll tell you – almost nothing and i’m in first place by some polls have me _UNK_ points .
that’s a lot .
okay ?
you know some people have 2 % .
i have a lead of 20 % .
but i’m in first place by a lot .
_UNK_ has spent now $ _UNK_ million .
think of it .
and you know the reason i bring him up – i wouldn’t even bring him up – but he spends a fortune on ads against me .
you people have all seen it before i got along with everybody .
i contributed to everybody .
i was a world class _UNK_ .
now i’m a politician , which i’d hate to tell you .
but you go with everybody .
you want to love everybody .
you want them all to love you unless you’re _UNK_ .
but you want everybody to love you .
everybody knows this story .
but so much money has been spent on me .
but he spent $ _UNK_ million .
i spend nothing .
i’m in first by a lot .
he’s down towards the bottom of the _UNK_ .
and i said to myself , `` it’s amazing .
wouldn’t that be great if this were the country doing this ? ''
as an example , education .
we’re number _UNK_ in the world .
we have third world countries that are ahead of us .
education is very important to me .
world , i mean , countries that you wouldn’t believe are ahead of us .
you wouldn’t believe if you heard the names of some of these countries .
so we’re _UNK_ but we’re number one in spending per _UNK_ by far .
wouldn’t it be nice if you had like this election process where we spent the least but we had the best education ?
you know ?
so _UNK_ and _UNK_ and china and others are the best .
we’re nowhere near them and yet we spend far more per _UNK_ .
so we’re going to change that and i told you we’re going to get it _UNK_ but we’re going to change that .
watch , you just watch ... i will tell you this : you can’t educate your children through bureaucrats in washington .
and that’s what happens with common core .
when the parents take over and i really mean this because i’ve seen it .
when the parents _UNK_ those schools and they love those kids and they love those _UNK_ and even when their kids graduate , they are committed to those schools , they’re committed to education .
you can do so much better in iowa than they can possibly do telling you what to do in washington .
and not all of them but most of them are just interested in `` where’s my check ?
how much do i get ?
let’s make the process complicated . ''
and some of the things that your kids are made to study are an outrage .
okay ?
so we’re going to bring that back _UNK_ and it’s going to be great .
so what happened essentially is i started looking and all of a sudden things changed .
and people are now looking .
they know i’ll do great with china .
i’m going to do great with japan .
i’m going to do great with mexico , who’s killing us in trade and killing us also at the border .
we will build a wall and you know who’s going to pay for the wall – mexico .
they’re going to pay for it because they make a fortune and all of those things .
but now , we’re really focused on security and i’m honored because i will tell you that all of polls and the cnn polls where said in particular that trump is just not by a little bit but by many , many percentage points winning on isis , winning on the military , winning with the vets .
we’re going to take care of our vets big league , by the way .
big league .
big league .
and we’re going to really take care of our military .
it’s going to be big and strong and powerful and _UNK_ going to mess with us and it’s the cheapest thing we can do , i’ll tell you that right now .
so it’s been a real focus .
i just want to now say just a couple of words about a very special person .
this is a person who i’ve known for a long time , who i’ve respected for so long .
an incredible husband .
an incredible family .
and somebody that when i heard that she was going to _UNK_ me , i was so honored .
you have no idea how honored .
and i would like to bring up if i might _UNK_ .
_UNK_ _UNK_ .
special , special person .
thank you .
speech 9 ( audience members _UNK_ ) _UNK_ let me just tell you _UNK_ let me just tell you a little secret .
it’s the cheapest thing we can do .
we’re never going to have to use it .
i don’t think we’re going to have to use it .
don’t forget they talk about my _UNK_ .
i remember when _UNK_ and hillary the same day _UNK_ mr. _UNK_ _UNK_ is not nice .
they’re _UNK_ off _UNK_ heads in syria and other places and they want me to have a nice _UNK_ .
i’m supposed to be , oh , isn’t life wonderful , _UNK_ ?
look , we’ve got to be tough , we’ve got to be smart , we’ve got to have heart too .
we’ve got to have heart , we’ve got to take care of people .
we’ve got to fix our health care program .
this obamacare is a disaster .
you people know .
you people know .
obamacare is a total catastrophe .
it’s going to be _UNK_ and replaced .
it will die in _UNK_ anyway .
i don’t know if you heard what’s happening .
but it’s so bad , all the people that they didn’t think were signing up are signing up .
and the other people that are really paying for it are not signing up .
and your rates are going up 25 percent , 35 percent , 45 percent .
your _UNK_ are so high that unless you get hit by a _UNK_ , you’re never going to be able to use your _UNK_ .
you’re never going to be able to use it .
so obamacare is a disaster .
we are going to repeal it , we are going to replace it .
there are so many great things we can do on health care .
so many good things .
speech 10 _UNK_ .
thank you .
thank you so much .
thank you .
we start by paying our great respects to pearl harbor .
we don’t want that stuff .
we don’t want world trade centers .
we don’t want that ever happen to us again .
it’s not going to happen to us again .
so i want to thank everybody for being here .
it’s a great honor .
they have thousands of people outside and sometimes they’ll say `` would you like to wait about an hour until they all come in ? ''
but we can’t get them in _UNK_ so what difference there .
we all got lucky .
we’re together tonight .
thank you .
so we have a lot of big news today .
to me , very big was cnn just came out with a new poll about an hour ago and iowa – great , great state – and in iowa , trump 33 % .
_UNK_ everybody by a lot .
you have cruz at 20 % and _UNK_ at 16 % and going down and _UNK_ at 11 % and bush at 4 % .
but it’s trump at 33 % .
it just came out .
it’s iowa – we love iowa .
by the way , great ship named after iowa too .
i’ve been on that one too .
a really great one .
the other big poll that came out just two days ago was the national poll .
trump _UNK_ % and then i won’t even mention the other numbers because they’re so low .
you know , when you have so many people running – we had 17 and then they started to drop .
_UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
i love it .
i love it .
and you’ll be losing a lot over the next little while .
i would imagine .
i don’t know .
when _UNK_ down at zero i would think that eventually they’ll drop out .
the only difference is there’s nothing to pick up if there is zero .
what do you pick up ?
so _UNK_ you’ll be seeing that .
one of the things i think that’s so important because to me very important in the same poll , which is the big national cnn poll , on the economy – so important – trump 55 % .
everyone else nothing .
on the budget – i’m really good at these things – economy , budgets .
i sort of expected this .
on the budget , trump – this is with 15 people remaining – trump _UNK_ % .
everyone else _UNK_ .
oh , here’s one that i started and i took a lot of heat .
i took a lot of heat .
sort of like the one we’re talking about today .
i guess you’ve heard a little bit about it .
but i’ve taken a lot of heat on this one .
illegal immigration .
now , had i not brought that up in trump tower in june when i announced that i was going to run for president , which takes courage to run for president , believe me .
you know , all of my life , i’ve heard that if you’re a successful person , especially if you have very success – you’ve done a lot of things , a lot of deals , a lot of everything , you can’t run for president .
and yet , that’s the kind of _UNK_ and thinking this country needs .
we’re being run by people that don’t know what they’re doing .
very _UNK_ .
on illegal immigration , trump _UNK_ % .
that’s with 15 people .
everyone else , no good .
on a thing called _UNK_ , don’t worry .
we’ll have plenty – we’ll talk a lot about isis .
can you believe it ?
here we have generals .
they go on television and talk .
they do all talk .
you people – a lot of military people here .
who’s military here ?
all right , i love you .
by the way , speaking of it , we’re going to make our military so strong , so powerful , so great , _UNK_ ever going to mess with us again .
nobody .
they’re never going to mess with us .
you know in many ways , it’s the cheapest thing we can do .
the cheapest thing .
instead of fighting these wars that we don’t know what we’re doing and we have leaders that are afraid to do anything , we’re going to make it so great , so strong that people – _UNK_ , they’re not _UNK_ .
they’re not _UNK_ .
and we’re going to take care of our great vets , our wounded warriors .
we’re going to take care of them .
because they – thank you , they are not being taken care of .
we have illegal immigrants that are taken care of better than our incredible veterans and it’s not going to happen any longer .
not going to happen .
not going to happen .
so with isis – trump _UNK_ % .
can you imagine that ?
with all of these _UNK_ running .
on foreign policy , trump way up .
and you know , in theory you could say `` well , maybe it’s not my thing . ''
but people want to see strong , they want to see strength , they want to see protection , they want to be protected .
and that’s it .
i watched last night and i watched the president truly that didn’t know what he was doing .
he didn’t know why he was there .
he refuses to use the term `` radical islamic terrorism '' .
he refuses to use the term .
i don’t even know if he knows what the hell is going on .
i really don’t .
and then we’re looking at hillary clinton .
honestly , i know hillary .
it’s just going to be an extension of obama .
i think maybe worse .
she’s got no strength .
she’s got no _UNK_ .
remember that .
you don’t need a president with no strength or _UNK_ when we’re being ripped off on trade , we’re being ripped off on obamacare , which is going to be _UNK_ and replaced by something really good .
when our soldiers aren’t being taken care of , when our military is never been like it is today .
one of the generals was on television , as usual , saying that we’re the least prepared now than _UNK_ that he’s ever seen it and he’s been there a long time _UNK_ .
that’s how we are .
in the most dangerous world we’ve ever had because of the power of weapons , we have people that don’t know – they don’t – i’m telling you .
i watch them .
i watch these generals being _UNK_ .
do you think _UNK_ george patton would be _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ be _UNK_ after total and complete victory .
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
they’re not big for _UNK_ .
you know , they shoot first , they talk later .
these guys – and i don’t think we’ll have to .
you know , just so you understand , bush – bush , he said yesterday he was being _UNK_ , he said that he was talking about me .
he was saying the _UNK_ things about me .
of course , he says he’ll be elected .
he’s at what 3 % ?
right ?
no , but he said some things and i was like – i said `` who says that about an opponent ?
you don’t say those things . ''
you’ll find out what he said .
but he said very nice things .
but , if you look at what happens where he is _UNK_ with me because he says the _UNK_ – the _UNK_ – of donald trump is not nice .
and i say it all the time .
we have people whose heads are being _UNK_ off in the middle east because they’re christian and for other reasons .
they’re being _UNK_ and _UNK_ in steel _UNK_ .
and we talk about my _UNK_ .
hillary said the same thing .
`` mr. _UNK_ _UNK_ is not nice . ''
these people are living in a different planet .
different planet .
and remember what i said about hillary .
we need somebody who’s strong .
we need somebody with incredible energy but incredible intelligence and all of those things .
you know , i know a lot of tough people but they’re not smart .
that’s no good .
they’re easy .
we need tough .
we need smart .
we need like every character .
we are so far behind the eight ball in this country .
we owe $ 19 trillion .
the budget they signed two weeks ago is going to make it $ _UNK_ trillion .
it’s a – think of it .
trillion .
trillion .
trillion dollars .
who the hell ever heard of the word 10 years ago ?
there was no such word .
we owe $ _UNK_ trillion in the very near future .
we’re really in trouble .
we have to rebuild our country .
we have to rebuild our infrastructure .
we have to rebuild our military .
and yet , we do deals with china where there’s a trade _UNK_ of over $ 400 billion a year in their favor , by the way , in case you had any question .
japan – they send their cars by the millions .
$ 70 billion a year _UNK_ .
that’s like a loss .
you look at mexico .
we’re going to build a wall .
it will be a real wall .
it will be a real wall .
_UNK_ _UNK_ happen .
it’s _UNK_ _UNK_ happen .
the people i’m dealing with – and you know , i really focus on hillary later because i have to get through these 15 people .
you know , there’s 15 of us .
i had _UNK_ came at me strong ; he went down .
i had _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , nice guy , he went down .
every guy that attacks me so far they’ve all gone down .
we’ve got to keep it that way , right ?
i mean , _UNK_ _UNK_ .
he’s at zero .
he’s at zero .
zero .
let me ask you a question .
i don’t get _UNK_ _UNK_ .
i don’t get _UNK_ literally at zero .
you see him .
and he keeps talking .
he gets so much television .
i mean , he’s on television all the time and he doesn’t go up .
he’s at zero , folks .
his ideas are so bad .
i’m more _UNK_ than him .
but i know how to win ; he doesn’t .
he just wants to attack everything .
he doesn’t know where the hell – _UNK_ _UNK_ .
and he always sits with john mccain .
it’s like they’re the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
they’re always sitting together .
no , it’s true .
do you ever notice ?
sometimes i want to see him by himself .
he’s always sitting with john mccain , who’s fine .
i’m not _UNK_ it .
but you got to know what to do .
now me , i was against the war in iraq .
so everyone says , you have the right _UNK_ – i have a great _UNK_ .
but you’ve got to attack .
if you’ve got to do something , you’ve got to know what you’re doing .
i said if you attack iraq and you wipe it out , iran is going to take over the entire middle east because you’re going to ruin the balance .
it was so simple to me .
and actually they sent a group from the white house to see me because i got so much _UNK_ , so much _UNK_ that they sent a group from the white house to see mr. trump .
i said , `` _UNK_ , you’re going to have iran take over the middle east and that’s what’s happening . ''
and iran’s going to take over iraq as sure as you’re sitting there .
and by the way , iraq , with the second largest oil reserves anywhere in the world .
we lost of thousands of lives .
we have wounded warriors all over the place .
$ 2 trillion .
we have nothing .
we got nothing .
we have absolutely nothing .
and we left .
and we have a president – we shouldn’t have been there but then we shouldn’t have left the way we left .
you know , the funny thing is i look at democrats and _UNK_ and _UNK_ and republicans – wouldn’t it be good all of us if we can get together and really make our country great again ?
is that what we want to do ?
i’ll bet you that if i spoke to that young woman , that quickly i really think i can convince her that we’re all in this together , folks .
we want to have a strong country .
right ?
_UNK_ you know , if you think about it and you’ll have some that can never be satisfied no matter what .
they’re just _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ .
but most people aren’t and they believe something .
and i have some very smart friends don’t agree with me ; they agree with the other side .
but i really believe that if you took it about making america great , we have to be strong , we have to be vigilant , and if we’re not vigilant – [ _UNK_ by _UNK_ ] – that was the same person .
i’ve got to tell you , so far , the security is not doing a great job in here , i’ll tell you that .
that was the same person .
you can do very nice but why don’t you get her out because honestly it’s _UNK_ .
so security , strengthen yourself up .
see , our country has this kind of security .
that’s the problem we _UNK_ her very _UNK_ please but she should now be taken out .
same person .
one person .
it’s one person .
they let her out .
they gave her a second chance and the same thing happens .
but you would think that everybody we’re all on the same _UNK_ that everybody every single person – [ _UNK_ by _UNK_ ] _UNK_ you would think that if we could get together , we’d all be in the same boat .
now , last night we all saw and we witnessed something that i thought was highly _UNK_ .
in fact , i _UNK_ `` is that all there is ? ''
about the president’s speech and i wrote something today that i think is very , very _UNK_ , very important , and probably not politically correct but i don’t care .
i don’t care .
you know , we had a situation in california very recently where somebody was making bombs in an apartment .
the mother saw them .
the mother didn’t notice anything wrong .
i watched the sister being _UNK_ .
believe me , in my opinion , she was lying like _UNK_ .
i watched that _UNK_ .
`` oh , my brother was such a wonderful guy .
i didn’t know , i didn’t know , i didn’t know . ''
and i watched the next door neighbor saying , `` oh , well we didn’t report them because we didn’t want to _UNK_ _UNK_ or we didn’t want to _UNK_ . ''
give me a break .
give me a break .
we’re like the _UNK_ country in so many different ways .
it’s so – can you imagine what our great leaders of the past would have said with the kind of _UNK_ that’s happening with us ?
they didn’t want to report them because they thought it was _UNK_ .
okay , they saw bombs .
they saw , you know , the _UNK_ bombs only this wasn’t to build a _UNK_ .
when a bomb is this long , can’t put too many of them together for a _UNK_ , right ?
and we thought they maybe but we didn’t want to _UNK_ _UNK_ .
oh , okay , you’re okay , you’re innocent .
or how about where the families and the _UNK_ and the wives and everything and they go back to world trade center – the worst , worse than pearl harbor because with the world trade center they were killing innocent civilians .
at least while it was a dirty , _UNK_ _UNK_ attack , at least they _UNK_ while it was an attack , at least it was military .
but this was an attack on the world trade center .
so , what’s happened is we’re out of control .
we have no idea who’s coming into our country .
we have no idea if they love us or if they hate us .
we have no idea if they want to bomb us .
we have no idea what’s going on .
and then i looked at poll numbers and i don’t mean polls where i’m winning ; those numbers i like looking at .
these numbers i hated to look at .
and it’s very , very _UNK_ .
i’ll go after some of the numbers .
25 % of those _UNK_ and this was from the center for security policy – very highly respected group of people who i know actually .
this is people living in this country .
25 % of those _UNK_ agreed that violence against americans is justified as muslims .
25 % .
_UNK_ % of the muslims living in this country – by the way , i have friends that are muslims ; they’re great people .
but they know we have a problem .
they know we have a real problem .
because _UNK_ going on , and we can’t put up with it , folks .
we can’t put up with it .
_UNK_ % – _UNK_ % highly respected number of polling groups want to be governed according to _UNK_ .
you know what _UNK_ is .
so i wrote this out .
the _UNK_ media wants to surrender the constitution .
the _UNK_ media – these people back here .
they’re the worst .
they are so _UNK_ .
no , no , they’re so _UNK_ .
they are so _UNK_ .
i mean , i have one from _UNK_ , a reporter from _UNK_ , and actually another one from _UNK_ , they actually in _UNK_ , ohio , i had a tremendous crowd like 10,000 people .
it was a love _UNK_ .
it went on for a long time .
everybody stayed right _UNK_ the end .
i had one of the politicians – _UNK_ – who is just getting – he’s a _UNK_ _UNK_ made a statement that `` oh , they left after 10 minutes . ''
now , the press was there .
they saw it .
nobody said it was a lie .
it was a total lie .
in fact , i had more people at the end than i had at the beginning .
_UNK_ leaving .
_UNK_ leaving here except for the one person that was screaming .
so , we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didn’t want to do that because it’s not their thing to do .
you know , we get the biggest crowds .
they don’t want to show this crowd tonight .
they’re not going to show all the people outside trying to get in .
they don’t do that .
they have the cameras right in my face .
i say fan the crowd just to show – look at all the people over here .
it’s a record in the history of this ship .
but they don’t show it .
they don’t show it .
no , no .
and i say fan it and they never ever fan it .
i say fan the crowd and they never fan it .
and yet , i guarantee you that that young woman that just got taken out after _UNK_ us three times , i guarantee the cameras will be on her .
i guarantee .
it’s _UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
_UNK_ by the way , some of the _UNK_ terrific but most of it 70 % , 75 % is absolute _UNK_ , absolute _UNK_ .
remember that .
_UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
they’re _UNK_ _UNK_ people .
i had one the other day where i finished the speech and they said `` oh , trump was _UNK_ and he left early . ''
i spoke for like 45 , 50 minutes .
i then answered questions and then i went around , you know , everybody knew it was false .
_UNK_ , there’s a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from _UNK_ .
she’s back there .
little _UNK_ .
she’s back there .
what a lie it was .
no , what a lie – _UNK_ _UNK_ – what a lie it was from _UNK_ to have written that .
it was a total lie .
and they did a story where they – i didn’t know they had a group like this where they actually _UNK_ the media .
and they said it was a total lie .
and i loved it .
i loved it .
i loved it .
and then other people pick it up .
you know it’s _UNK_ so somebody _UNK_ it up .
third rate reporter .
remember that .
third rate .
third rate .
so i said here the _UNK_ media wants to surrender our constitution and our constitutional rights .
and i don’t want that .
i want isis to surrender .
okay ?
i want isis to surrender .
very simple .
it’s very simple .
so here’s what happened .
it’s been a little controversial .
it’s been a great day because the poll numbers are through the roof .
i like that .
but i have _UNK_ wish we could call – is there any way we could call the election tomorrow ?
wouldn’t you love that ?
now they’re coming at us in full force .
they’re coming – not coming at me .
they’re coming at all of us .
they’re coming at all of us .
because you know , we have a noisy majority .
they used to call it the quiet majority .
people are fed up .
they’re fed up with _UNK_ .
they’re fed up with _UNK_ leaders .
they’re fed up with _UNK_ people .
they are fed up with _UNK_ people , where our president makes a deal for sergeant _UNK_ , a dirty , _UNK_ , no good _UNK_ who – think of it .
they knew he was a _UNK_ because a general and a _UNK_ went to see his group .
six people were killed looking for him .
okay ?
six people were killed .
young .
_UNK_ .
i watched the parents on television .
i’ve seen the parents .
but i watched the parents on television devastated , will never be the same .
they left to try to bring them back .
he left .
he _UNK_ .
you know , in the old days when we were strong country it would be boom , gone .
it was called _UNK_ .
now i heard the other day they won’t even do anything to him .
can you believe it ?
they think he’s going to get away with nothing .
he’s going to have nothing .
so he left .
oh , they treated him pretty rough though .
he got in there , he said , `` i shouldn’t have done this .
this isn’t working out the way i thought . ''
_UNK_ , so we get him back and here’s the deal we made .
we get a dirty , no good _UNK_ .
six people _UNK_ get five of their greatest killers that they’ve been after – after – think of it for six years .
in fact , i hear nine years .
so they get these – right now have gone – they’re out in the battlefield , trying to kill everybody in front of them including you folks , i’d hate to tell you .
so we get _UNK_ and they get five of the killers that they’ve wanted for many years .
that’s the way we do it .
the iran deal .
we gave them $ 150 billion .
it’s called _UNK_ night .
we gave them $ 150 billion .
24 days – 24 days – we think there’s something wrong , 24 days we have to wait but it’s much longer than that because there’s a whole process before the clock starts _UNK_ .
so it could be forever .
but the best is where they have the right to _UNK_ .
`` are you doing nuclear weapons over there ? ''
`` oh , we’ll _UNK_ tomorrow . ''
`` oh no , we’re not doing nuclear weapons . ''
you know , the _UNK_ are great negotiators .
always have been .
and somebody would say that’s _UNK_ .
trust me , they’re great negotiators .
and kerry is a _UNK_ _UNK_ and obama is a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
he’s a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
these people are _UNK_ .
i always obama would be a _UNK_ .
i never thought of him as being like a _UNK_ because i said `` you know what ?
i don’t think he’s going to be a good president . ''
i backed mccain ; he lost by the way .
and you know , i don’t blame mccain for losing because a lot of bad things will happen ; it was a tough one .
but i backed mccain ; he lost .
i backed romney ; he should have won but he sort of went away on vacation or something the last month and he lost .
and i said , `` this time i’m going to do it myself .
we’re not going to lose . ''
we’re not going to lose .
we’re not losing .
and the recent fox poll that just came out has me _UNK_ hillary very easily one on one .
i love that .
that’s so important .
so , we put out a statement today .
we watched this .
and it’s impossible to watch this gross _UNK_ but i watched last night .
and we put out a statement a little while ago and these people are going _UNK_ shall i read you the statement ?
donald _UNK_ trump is calling for – now , you’ve got to listen to this because this is pretty heavy stuff and it’s common sense and we have to do it .
remember the poll numbers .
25 % , _UNK_ % .
remember the poll numbers .
so remember this .
so listen .
donald _UNK_ trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on .
we have no choice .
we have no choice .
we have no choice .
according to _UNK_ research , among others , there is a great hatred toward americans by large _UNK_ of the muslim population .
most recently , a poll from center for security policy released data showing 25 % of those _UNK_ agreed that violence against americans – these are people that are here by the way , people that are here – 25 % not 1 % .
by the way , 1 % would be unacceptable .
1 % is unacceptable .
25 % of those _UNK_ agreed that violence against americans here in the united states is justified as part – think of that – as part of the global _UNK_ .
they want to change your religion .
i don’t think so .
i don’t think so .
i don’t think so .
not going to happen .
as part of the global _UNK_ .
and _UNK_ % of those _UNK_ agreed that muslims in america should have the choice of being governed according to _UNK_ .
you know what _UNK_ is .
_UNK_ % .
_UNK_ _UNK_ – now look , this is , i mean , it’s terrible .
_UNK_ _UNK_ such atrocities as _UNK_ against _UNK_ who won’t _UNK_ , _UNK_ , and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to americans especially women .
i mean , you look – especially women .
tough stuff .
and we have a president that won’t even mention the term and you’re talking about numbers like this .
mr. trump stated without looking at the various polling data , it’s obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond _UNK_ where the hatred comes from and why , we’ll have to determine .
we’ll have to figure it out .
we have to figure it out .
we can’t live like this .
it’s going to get worse and worse .
you’re going to have more world trade centers .
it’s going to get worse and worse folks .
we could be politically correct and we can be _UNK_ but it’s going to get worse and worse .
until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses , our country can not be the victim of _UNK_ attacks by people that believe only in _UNK_ .
these are people only believe in _UNK_ .
they don’t want our system .
they don’t want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life .
they have no respect for human life .
_UNK_ _UNK_ to paris , which was a disaster , which by the way if some of the people in those places where it was slaughter , absolute slaughter , had guns , you wouldn’t have had the carnage that you had in paris .
you wouldn’t had that carnage .
if they had guns , you wouldn’t had that carnage .
so important the second amendment .
we have to preserve it and cherish it .
and we can’t let these weak leaders _UNK_ it .
if they had guns in paris , if five people in that room , paris and france has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and it was like target practice .
`` come over here .
boom !
come over here .
boom ! ''
people are sitting by the hundreds and many others are going to be dying .
they’re sitting in the hospital in many cases waiting to die .
now , the same thing a few days ago in california .
no guns .
we didn’t have guns .
the bad guys had the guns .
and these young people – and i tell the press you’ve got to stop calling them `` _UNK_ '' – these are dirty , _UNK_ _UNK_ .
these aren’t _UNK_ .
remember the guy in paris with the big dirty _UNK_ ?
remember the guy in paris – the `` _UNK_ '' .
i was watching all the networks .
i won’t mention who but some of them _UNK_ me .
`` the _UNK_ is on the loose . ''
and we have kids that are watching the internet and they want to be _UNK_ and then you wonder why do we lose all these kids – they go over there .
they’re young .
they’re _UNK_ .
they go over there and they want to join isis .
and we have our _UNK_ – i think i got them mostly stopped .
did you notice that ?
i don’t hear it too much .
but they say `` the young _UNK_ '' .
oh , he’s brilliant .
young man , he’s brilliant .
i don’t even he’s got a high _UNK_ paris , i call him the guy with the dirty _UNK_ _UNK_ .
okay ?
not a smart guy .
a _UNK_ .
puts people in there – _UNK_ – _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , it’s like shooting everybody .
you’ve got to be a _UNK_ .
so the press has to be responsible .
they’re not being responsible because we’re losing a lot of people because of the internet .
and we have to do something .
we have to go see bill gates and a lot of different people that really understand what’s happening .
we have to talk to them .
maybe in certain areas closing that internet up in some way .
somebody will `` oh , freedom of speech , freedom of speech '' .
these are _UNK_ people .
we have a lot of _UNK_ people .
we have a lot of _UNK_ people .
we’ve got to maybe do something with the internet because they are recruiting by the thousands .
they’re leaving our country .
and then when they come back , we take them back .
`` oh , come on back .
where were you ? ''
`` i was fighting for isis . ''
`` oh , come on back .
go home .
enjoy yourself . ''
when they leave our country and they go to fight for isis or any of the other groups , they never come back .
they never can come back .
they never can come back .
they can never , ever , ever come back .
it’s over .
how about that ?
and now that they’ve become radicalized , they’re _UNK_ radicalized .
and how about the woman ?
she was in pakistan then saudi arabia .
she comes in on an engagement deal and she radicalized the guy .
probably a guy who couldn’t get women .
i don’t know what the hell his problem is .
it’s probably the first women he’s ever had .
i don’t know what was going on .
but he became radicalized quickly .
notice how easy it is ?
he becomes radicalized and then they go on a _UNK_ .
folks , those days are over .
those days are over .
we have to be tough .
we have to be smart .
we have to be vigilant .
yes , we have to look at mosques and we have to respect mosques .
but yes , we have to look at mosques .
we have no choice .
we have to see what’s happening because something is happening in there .
man , there’s anger .
there’s anger .
and we have to know about it .
we can’t be these people that are sitting back like in the world trade center , like so many different things .
we can’t be people that knew what was going on two weeks ago in california , probably for months they knew what was going on and they didn’t want to tell anybody .
we can’t be that .
we have to be strong .
when we see violations , you have to report those violations and quickly .
don’t worry about _UNK_ .
i promise i will defend you from _UNK_ .
i promise .
so when i started this whole quest – i mean , who knew it was going to turn into this ?
it’s been an amazing thing .
no matter where i go , i have tremendous crowds , _UNK_ crowds , _UNK_ .
we went to dallas – 20,000 people in dallas .
_UNK_ people .
mobile , alabama – _UNK_ people .
here , every time i come to south carolina , every time i go to north carolina , every time i go to iowa , new hampshire , virginia , wherever i go – florida – we have crowds that are _UNK_ .
the only problem we have is the size of the room – thousands of people outside trying to get in .
usually i do a double .
i go talk to them for a while , which i wouldn’t say i exactly love doing after the first one .
but there is an _UNK_ love in these rooms – all the same .
i love you too .
i love _UNK_ you .
thank you .
i love you too .
there’s an _UNK_ love in all of these places – oklahoma – 20,000 people standing in a park on quick notice .
there’s an _UNK_ love .
and there’s an _UNK_ love of the country .
we want to see good things .
we don’t want to be bad people .
we don’t want to be tough and _UNK_ .
we believe in the constitution more than anybody .
but we can’t let people use and abuse our rights .
we can’t let people kill us .
they want to kill us .
they want to destroy us .
we can’t let it happen .
we just can’t let it happen .
and i have a friend who’s a very , very successful man , and i went to one event – he came with me .
we had _UNK_ people .
and this _UNK_ a real tough _UNK_ .
he’s a great financial guy .
one of the guys i’d definitely use to negotiate with japan , china .
believe me , you’re going to be in good shape when that happens .
we won’t have these _UNK_ .
you know , this whole thing with all of these guys .
by the way , i’m the only one that’s _UNK_ my campaign .
everyone else is controlled .
only one .
i’m the only one .
only one .
i’m _UNK_ my campaign .
and these other guys .
you know , they’re getting millions and millions of dollars from people i know .
i have one guy came and wanted to give me a lot of money .
i said , `` honestly , i can’t take it .
i don’t want to do . ''
i can’t take it , which is very sort of like for me to not take money – my whole life i’ve been taking money .
now i’m sort of like what am i doing ?
but came in and i said , `` so what are you going to do ?
i don’t want your money . ''
and he said , `` i got to go someplace else . ''
they’re like _UNK_ .
they’re like _UNK_ .
but i said , `` you like me best . ''
`` i like you best but i’m going to go someplace else . ''
because they want to be part – they want to – _UNK_ me tell you , who is more than me ?
i gave millions to these guys .
nobody knows the system better than me .
i knew it from the other side .
don’t forget , i was the _UNK_ boy .
i was like the _UNK_ .
they’d all come to me , and i’d give them all money i write checks sometimes to senators whatever the _UNK_ – _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
i used to say `` senators , don’t come to my office .
anybody that’s a u.s. senator that calls me , we’ll send you a campaign contribution . ''
but you know what ?
i’ll tell you something .
in the end , the people that gives these millions of dollars to these _UNK_ , corrupt _UNK_ – they’re corrupt – they _UNK_ control bush and _UNK_ and i won’t say cruz because he’s been very nice to me .
_UNK_ , he’s been nice .
he’s got to hit me first .
once he hits me , i promise you .
i promise you .
no , i’ve been nice to _UNK_ but he really hit me today .
chris _UNK_ .
i mean , i don’t know .
he’s a friend of mine but he’s not doing well in the polls and he really , really hit me today .
he hated this and yet he said anybody could come .
you’ve got to look at some of the statements from the past .
but he really hit me on the whole thing that we have to stop the muslims until we find out what’s going on .
does that make sense by the way ?
until we find out .
and he talked about – that’s _UNK_ and you know in other words he has experience right ?
but that’s the statement of an _UNK_ _UNK_ we have to stop people that want to kill us from coming in .
does that sound like _UNK_ ?
so chris , who’s a friend of mine , he hit me hard .
and i said i got to hit him at least once .
so i won’t do this a lot .
look , here’s the story .
the george washington bridge .
he knew about it .
hey , how do you have breakfast with people everyday of your lives , they’re closing up the largest bridge in the world , the biggest in the united states , traffic flowing during rush hour .
people couldn’t get across for 6 , 7 hours .
_UNK_ , fire trucks .
they’re with him all the time – the people that did it .
they never said , `` hey boss , we’re closing up the george washington bridge tonight . ''
no , they never said that .
they’re talking about the weather , right ?
he knew about it .
he knew about it .
_UNK_ knew about it .
he’s a got a very friendly group of people over there that they don’t think so .
but i don’t know .
it’s called life .
you’ve got to be smart in life .
i would say there’s less than 1 % chance .
it could be but i doubt it .
he knew about it .
they didn’t mention at one of their meetings ?
i think they had breakfast like everyday or every other day .
they’d just say , `` chris , tonight we’re closing up the george washington bridge because the mayor a certain area is against you . ''
`` oh , okay . ''
they didn’t mention ?
nobody believes that .
number two .
nine _UNK_ of the state .
nine _UNK_ .
it’s a disaster .
i have property over there – the taxes are through – i’ll use an expression – coming out of my _UNK_ , okay ?
tremendous taxes over there .
you had nine _UNK_ .
you had _UNK_ , you know , so friendly with president obama during the _UNK_ .
i actually called .
i said , `` let me ask you .
is he going to vote for obama ? ''
i thought he was going to vote for obama .
i don’t know .
i think he possibly did .
and romney i was very _UNK_ .
one of the reasons i was _UNK_ was he called _UNK_ and had dinner right after the election .
if _UNK_ did that to me , i would have never spoken to him again .
i would have never done it .
so when chris talks about – when he talks about lack of experience – i built this incredible company .
i _UNK_ papers where everyone said `` _UNK_ , that is _UNK_ . ''
i would have probably _UNK_ them even when i didn’t run because i built a great , great company .
tremendous cash .
tremendous assets .
tremendous net worth .
very little debt .
_UNK_ cash flow .
and i _UNK_ .
everybody said `` number one , he won’t run . ''
and i ran .
i took a deep breath and i said , `` let’s go '' to my wife and we came down that _UNK_ .
right , the famous _UNK_ .
hopefully in many years that will be a very famous scene because we will have turned around our country and that will be a positive note , okay ?
but then they said , `` oh , well he announced . ''
so these talking heads – most of whom are not even smart people , believe me .
then they’d say well , they went to _UNK_ league college .
so did i go to _UNK_ league college .
they went to this .
most of them didn’t go to _UNK_ league colleges by the way but they say they’re brilliant .
one’s brilliant because he wears _UNK_ , you know ?
like _UNK_ .
remember _UNK_ ?
we don’t like him .
but what happens is they say `` well , he’ll never file form a . ''
that’s basically where you sign your life away .
i _UNK_ form a. then they said , `` well , he’ll never sign his financial statement because maybe he’s not as rich as everybody thinks . ''
then they said , `` and if he does , he’ll ask for many , many delays because you’re entitled to 45 day delays , delays , and you can delay it until forever .
and they’ll delay it until after the election . ''
i said , `` no '' so i _UNK_ it ahead of schedule .
and what happened ?
remember ?
they went down .
they couldn’t believe it .
it was much , much , much better than anybody ever _UNK_ .
i built a great company and the reason – honestly worth billions and billions of dollars .
remember that – low debt , great cash flow , and the greatest assets – _UNK_ , trump tower , the trump building , big chunk of the bank of america building in san _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ , land all over , land on the _UNK_ , land all over .
in north carolina , i have a great piece of property .
trump national _UNK_ _UNK_ .
some of you know it .
great , right at the best _UNK_ .
and what happens ?
what happens ?
so i _UNK_ and everyone said `` oh , i can’t believe it . ''
then they said `` well , maybe he won’t do so well with the polls . ''
and you know , before i went , people never believed i was going to run .
they never thought i was going to run .
and i told the story the other night for really the first real time .
but my wife said to me `` you know if you run you will win .
don’t you ? ''
she’s very smart .
i said , `` what do you mean ? ''
she said , `` if you don’t run , you’re never going to poll before .
nobody believes you’re going to run . ''
so if they do polls like they did these early polls , they weren’t great before i announced .
she said , `` no , the only way you’re going to get a poll number is you’ve got to announce . ''
nobody believes even though they say , even though they say you’re running , it doesn’t matter .
nobody believes you’re running .
so i said , `` all right . ''
i’m getting these _UNK_ early numbers and i’m saying , `` i don’t know .
i don’t want to run and find out it doesn’t work . ''
i don’t want to be _UNK_ like _UNK_ _UNK_ and all these guys who have nothing .
it’s true .
it’s true .
so i said , `` all right .
let’s take it . ''
so we go down on the _UNK_ .
you know what i did ?
you remember i took a deep breath because i’m telling you and you know what i’m talking about the press down there look like the academy _UNK_ .
there were so many cameras .
i have never seen anything like it .
the entire _UNK_ of trump tower was _UNK_ with cameras and press .
and i just said , `` let’s go '' to my wife .
i took a deep breath and i went down and i talked about _UNK_ of things , including illegal immigration .
and illegal immigration was such a big subject .
and i’m telling you had i not brought it up , it has turned out to be – and i took heat .
i took heat like nobody has ever taken heat .
rush _UNK_ said `` the most incredible incoming that i’ve ever seen a human being endure '' .
and then he doubled down a week later because i was right .
and now , illegal immigration is one of the biggest things .
and then you had the killing of _UNK_ [ _UNK_ ] and the killing of _UNK_ and the killing recently in california of a _UNK_ – think of it , _UNK_ – veteran , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ and killed by an illegal immigrant .
and many , many more .
it’s a huge problem .
and they take our jobs and a lot of other things .
so all of a sudden , _UNK_ saying `` _UNK_ '' _UNK_ from almost at the beginning , you’ve seen i’ve been at the top like from almost day one .
_UNK_ reason i tell you certain things and the reason i talk about what i’ve done and _UNK_ of good things .
a little thing – _UNK_ ice _UNK_ _UNK_ .
the city couldn’t get it built for high years .
they were in there for like $ 20 million .
they couldn’t get it done .
i went to the mayor of new york , i said , `` ed _UNK_ , i’ll get it done real quick . ''
he didn’t like it because he didn’t want to be shown up .
i said i’ll do it and if it costs more than $ 2 million i’ll pay for it .
i got it built for _UNK_ .
got it done in four months .
and we had ice _UNK_ in central park and i still run it .
i did another one – i did a bigger version of that recently _UNK_ point out in the _UNK_ .
they were having – things have been under construction from anywhere between 20 and 30 years .
they couldn’t get it done .
i got it done under a year .
it’s operating now .
it’s very successful .
it’s what i do and that’s what we need .
that’s what we need in our country .
i’m building on pennsylvania avenue an incredible _UNK_ .
one of the great _UNK_ of the world .
the old post office site .
think of it .
i got it in the obama administration .
everybody was _UNK_ .
everybody wanted it .
one of the most sought after projects in the history of the _UNK_ – general services .
and i got it .
can you imagine me getting it from the obama administration ?
because the _UNK_ , who are really professionals , they want to make sure number one that it got built .
so they wanted strong _UNK_ .
and they also wanted a great plan .
so we came up with _UNK_ and my kids we came up with this incredible plan .
the job is under budget , ahead of schedule .
it was going to open up in _UNK_ – sometime during the year _UNK_ .
now , it’s going to open probably in september of _UNK_ right before the election on pennsylvania avenue .
and this is the kind of _UNK_ you need .
carl _UNK_ , one of the great businessmen , and others have _UNK_ me .
we have trillions and trillions of dollars offshore .
_UNK_ leaving the united states .
in the old days , somebody would leave for , frankly , south carolina .
they’d leave new york or florida or someplace where the taxes are lower .
they’d leave for north carolina .
they’d leave – today they’d leave this country for other countries .
so now , we’re losing _UNK_ .
we’re losing many of our great companies .
we have $ 2.5 trillion offshore at least .
and everybody agrees it should come home – the democrats , the republicans .
for three years , they can’t make a deal .
they can’t make a deal because there’s such gridlock .
there’s no leadership in washington .
we will make this country so great .
we have people and i’ll tell you something .
i’ll tell you _UNK_ [ _UNK_ by _UNK_ ] said something to me the other day and what i really want to do – [ _UNK_ by _UNK_ ] – what we want to do or what i want to do is i want to be the people’s president .
_UNK_ of this , think of this , i don’t work for any of the lobbyists .
i don’t work for any of these people that are leading our country in the wrong direction .
we don’t .
_UNK_ best thing that i’ve seen in going around and the thing that i’ve seen more than anything else is how smart the people are .
they don’t believe those people in the back that write with _UNK_ .
i’m telling you , they don’t believe them .
the people are really smart .
what’s giving me more inspiration than any other single thing are the people that i’ve met – the incredible people of this country .
we’re going to make america great again .
and you know what ?
we’re going to make it greater , greater , than ever before .
and i love you all and thank you very much .
south carolina .
great .
thank you !
we love you .
thank you !
thank you very much , everybody .
you just like me because my daughter happens to be jewish .
right ?
she has a great husband , _UNK_ , and i’ll tell you what _UNK_ could not be _UNK_ and she’s very proud .
the only bad news , i can’t get her on saturday .
i call and i call .
i can’t speak to my daughter anymore on _UNK_ .
but that’s okay .
it’s an honor to be with you .
you know , i’ve devoted so much time over my life to israel , and the other politicians they can talk but believe me they haven’t done what i’ve done .
i’ve received many , many _UNK_ .
i was the grand _UNK_ of the israeli day parade at a very dangerous time when people said , `` don’t do it .
don’t do it . ''
i walked up fifth avenue .
i’m looking up for _UNK_ of trouble .
but i said , `` no way am i not going to do it . ''
and it was a rough time as you know .
it was _UNK_ , and it was a _UNK_ successful parade .
maybe their most successful parade that they ever had .
so , i’m in a different position than the other candidates because i’m the one candidate i don’t want any of your money ; i want your support but i don’t want your money .
i’m _UNK_ my campaign .
it’s been an amazing experience for me because i have very little money invested so far .
i thought by this time i’d have about 30 million in ads and i have none although i took a small radio commercial the other day in iowa .
but we have virtually no money in invested in ads or _UNK_ .
and i think you as business people will feel pretty good about this and respect it .
at first , i was _UNK_ by that .
i said , `` you know , i think we’re going to have spend money just to spend money '' but it’s not really like a good thing to do because i am in first place by a lot .
it’s not even close .
every single poll , every single state .
the numbers just came in three minutes ago in new hampshire – the _UNK_ poll – trump at 27 % , the next one is 13 % , 10 % , 9 % , 8 % , 5 % , and the rest are off the board .
they have to drop out pretty soon i guess , right ?
most of importantly , _UNK_ – no , i still like the top number the most but _UNK_ is now at 50 % to _UNK_ % , which is good , and i beat hillary in the fox poll as you see very easily _UNK_ % to _UNK_ % .
that’s ultimately the most important .
and you know , i’ve been a tremendous fan and i’ve been a tremendous _UNK_ .
i’ve given a lot of money recently to _UNK_ , $ 100,000 , emergency response .
they do a _UNK_ job .
and my father , _UNK_ , was always a big supporter .
so i grew up in that environment .
i grew up in _UNK_ , _UNK_ , and israel was always very _UNK_ in our mind .
in fact , i’ve been sometimes _UNK_ because i received so many _UNK_ from jewish groups , and they look at my wall .
it’s _UNK_ up .
but now the christians are _UNK_ up , i have to tell you .
my christians are _UNK_ me a lot lately and they’ve been great .
they have been great .
so , obama is the worst thing that’s ever happened to israel .
the worst .
the worst .
and when i see great friends of mine who are very , very _UNK_ , very – i mean , they love israel .
they love it with passion , and they’re having _UNK_ for obama .
i said , `` what are you doing ? ''
and it’s almost like they answer me and they say , `` we don’t know .
he comes to new york .
we don’t know .
we don’t know . ''
i said he’s a disaster .
i really believe the iran deal .
look , i’m a _UNK_ like you folks .
we’re negotiators .
we don’t build gas stations in the middle of , as you know , afghanistan for $ _UNK_ million – can you imagine this ?
a small gas station – $ _UNK_ million – and then they used the wrong kind of _UNK_ because they don’t sell that type of gas .
okay ?
$ _UNK_ million for a gas station .
how many think they could have done it for less ?
would you raise your hands please ?
but i look at obama , i look at that deal where we gave to iran $ 150 billion .
they don’t need to develop nuclear weapons ; they can buy them .
they can buy them .
it’s true .
why do they have to develop them ?
they can buy them .
we gave them $ 150 billion .
they go out and in terms of , you know , surveillance , they have the right to _UNK_ .
how about that ?
on their major , most dangerous they can _UNK_ .
we’re going to let them _UNK_ .
and then you have of course the 24 days and the 24 days we’re all good with contracts don’t start until such and such happens .
it could be forever before you ever go into _UNK_ .
and we don’t even get our prisoners back .
and now they want to start a negotiation to get the prisoners back and they want 19 people for our three .
they don’t want to give us our four .
you know we have four .
but they only want to talk three .
now , that should have been negotiated right at the beginning , three years ago .
and maybe better than any audience , i mean , the people in this room understand what i’m saying .
it should have been you walk in – by the way , did you ever see a negotiation take so long ?
and we _UNK_ on every single .
we didn’t win anything .
we didn’t win anything .
but that should have been with our prisoners – day one , whatever it is years ago , we have to get our prisoners back .
you don’t want them .
we need them .
it will make us look better .
both everybody is going to like us more .
with the american public , any deal that we strike , it’s going to look good .
and you say that .
we have to get our prisoners back .
day one .
they’re going to say , `` no , we’re not giving . ''
and we’re going to say , `` _UNK_ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ !
call us when you’re ready . ''
and then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions .
i guarantee you within _UNK_ hours they’re calling , _UNK_ us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back .
it’s so easy .
now , the president , you saw that , and john kerry , who is probably the worst _UNK_ i’ve ever seen .
no , he’s the worst _UNK_ i’ve ever seen .
he did not read the _UNK_ of the deal , folks , i can tell you that .
now , he’s one of the few .
he’s one of the – biggest selling of all time business book of all time , he didn’t read it .
and obama definitely didn’t read it .
obama , _UNK_ .
oh .
but they said – this is hard to believe but this is what they said – a lot of press back there so i have to say everything exactly correct because if i don’t i end up with a – they said we didn’t want to _UNK_ the negotiations by asking for the prisoners .
it’s really complicated .
we want our prisoners back .
oh , so complicated .
they said they didn’t want to _UNK_ – so now , we’re going to end up making a new deal probably at some point .
i’d tell you this , look i’ll just tell you this : if i win , before i take office , i guarantee you those prisoners are going to be back .
they’re going to be back , i guarantee you .
they’re going to be back .
now , our president doesn’t want to use the term – we had another event , which probably was – the one yesterday – probably was related .
it always happens but it probably was .
when i heard about it , i figured maybe not .
but it turns out probably was related – radical islamic terrorism .
and i’ll tell you what , we have a president that refuses to use the term .
he refuses to say .
there’s something going on with him that we don’t know about .
now , as far as _UNK_ concerned , she’s going to go with what he wants .
she shouldn’t be allowed to run .
what she did is criminal with the emails .
she shouldn’t be allowed to run .
she’s going to have to follow his line because she’s on a thread .
you know , look , in real life , his attorney general , his u.s. attorney , his attorney general .
so his attorney general is going to listen to him in my opinion .
i think it’s very _UNK_ what’s going on with our government .
_UNK_ [ david ] petraeus was given a _UNK_ sentence .
other people have been sent to jail .
petraeus was , you know , essentially – look , i don’t want to get into it with the poor guy .
what he went – for nothing , compared to what she did for nothing , for 5 % of what she did .
and obama , i mean , she can’t go against him because only does boom she gets _UNK_ .
that’s the end of it .
that’s the end of it .
so when you see hillary _UNK_ up virtually everything he says , and he’s got control of her .
i mean , it’s just total control .
but i’ll tell you what , she shouldn’t be allowed to run .
what she did was a criminal act .
and remember this , this is a _UNK_ – you have a six year _UNK_ of limitations .
so she’s fighting for her life .
if she doesn’t become president , she could have a real problem .
does that make any sense to anybody ?
does that make sense to anybody ?
because what she did was just wrong .
okay ?
and you know she’s been involved in corruption her whole life , whether it’s _UNK_ .
i mean , her whole life is corruption .
she was a _UNK_ secretary of state .
she did a _UNK_ job other than traveled a lot .
she traveled a lot , nothing ever got done .
the whole – the world _UNK_ up around her .
it _UNK_ up .
500 to 600 calls and emails and everything from our ambassador asking for help and she didn’t respond .
the truth is she doesn’t have the strength or the energy .
she responded to her friends .
you know the friends we’re talking about .
some of those friends are , you know , sort of an interesting friend going on there .
but she responded – yeah , you get that , right ?
a lot of people don’t get that .
but she responded to a friend , but she doesn’t respond to an ambassador that’s asking for help .
hundreds – hundreds of _UNK_ and she doesn’t respond .
now , remember this , i go every night to someplace .
i mean , yesterday i was in _UNK_ , virginia , we had an _UNK_ crowd .
the other day i was in florida , we had _UNK_ people in _UNK_ at 12 _UNK_ with the football games going on .
_UNK_ people .
the convention center held _UNK_ so we had thousands outside .
i made a speech outside .
i made two _UNK_ said , `` you can’t get me a larger convention center so i can do one speech ? ''
my people said , `` no , this is the biggest one .
we set a record – a big record .
we set a record everywhere .
we beat the record of _UNK_ john .
it’s true .
_UNK_ john .
i’m no longer competing with politicians .
i’m competing with the _UNK_ talent .
one of the great _UNK_ said `` you get the largest crowds of any single human being on earth without a _UNK_ '' meaning who doesn’t count on music .
so it’s true , we’ve had tremendous response .
we’ve had incredible response .
i think you know if you look at what’s going on and i think based on the response , based on the polls – again i don’t want your money therefore you’re probably not going to support me because _UNK_ you want to give money .
trump doesn’t want money therefore we can’t – even though he’s better than all these guys , even though he’s going to do more for israel than anybody else , even though _UNK_ netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for him and i did and he won his race , so i was very happy about that .
but he asked me to do a commercial .
and they said i was the only celebrity .
i don’t know if that’s – but they said i’m the only celebrity .
i don’t know .
i’m not a celebrity .
see now i’m a politician .
i’m so _UNK_ by that term .
you know , my how life i’ve been a business , i’ve been a _UNK_ .
i’ve _UNK_ tens of thousands of people over my lifetime .
i have _UNK_ statements and _UNK_ company .
a lot of people said , `` oh , he’ll never file . ''
this you’ll get a kick out of .
`` he’ll never run because he’ll never want to file various papers .
and then he’ll never file this and that and then you’d have to sign your life away . ''
the first paper – we all know about first papers .
you sign your life away .
that’s the end of it .
he did it .
then they said , `` well , he’ll never sign and he’ll never file his _UNK_ because who knows , maybe he’s not as rich as people think . ''
so i _UNK_ my _UNK_ – almost 100 pages .
the biggest ever _UNK_ by the federal elections .
and everybody said , `` oh my , it’s much bigger and much stronger and holy _UNK_ , look at these numbers ! ''
_UNK_ i didn’t run , i’d probably would have _UNK_ _UNK_ because you know i built a great company and i like to _UNK_ about it whenever possible .
it’s true .
some of the greatest assets – _UNK_ , you know , _UNK_ and _UNK_ in _UNK_ and trump tower and many buildings in manhattan .
just many – bank of america building in san _UNK_ with a great partner and so many other buildings and _UNK_ and the reason i bring that up is because that’s the kind of thinking we need .
and i don’t bring it up as _UNK_ .
i bring it up because that’s the kind of thinking we need in this country to bring us back .
we have people that don’t know the first thing about the word negotiation .
i can take anybody in this office , believe me , and they’re better than obama and they’re better than kerry and they’re better than the _UNK_ people – the _UNK_ people .
it’s so _UNK_ when you see what happens .
sergeant _UNK_ , all right ?
sergeant _UNK_ – we get a _UNK_ ; they get five of the greatest killers that they’ve wanted for nine years .
you know , the deal was five for one .
and they knew he was a _UNK_ before we made the deal .
you know about sergeant _UNK_ .
he _UNK_ .
six people were killed trying to get him back .
they were looking for him .
the general and the _UNK_ went to see all those people , they said , `` no , he _UNK_ .
he was a _UNK_ . ''
and we still made the deal .
so we get a _UNK_ .
we can give him back .
do you want to _UNK_ deals ?
some of us will _UNK_ deals .
i would say about _UNK_ – is there anybody that doesn’t _UNK_ deals in this room ?
this room _UNK_ so i want to _UNK_ – perhaps more than any room than i’ve ever spoken .
maybe more .
it’s okay .
i’ve been called on that a couple of times too .
but the fact is i want to _UNK_ that deal .
i want to drop him right _UNK_ in the middle of where he came from .
the hell – they can have him even if we don’t get the five guys back because that’s not going to happen because you know where they are right now ?
they’re right now all in the battlefield fighting us and trying to kill us and kill anybody that gets in .
so they get their five guys that they’ve wanted for nine years they’ve wanted them and we get a dirty _UNK_ _UNK_ .
but that’s the way our people negotiate .
they’re _UNK_ people .
okay ?
they’re _UNK_ people .
it’s very _UNK_ .
it’s very _UNK_ .
so i’ll just tell you that i’m going to win .
i am .
i’m going to win .
i mean , unless something happens , you know , walk across the street , the wrong thing happens .
but i’ll tell you what , i have a great secret service .
here’s a nice one , you’re number one , they give you a secret service .
i never saw so many people – talented people , great people .
but i believe i’m going to win .
i really have just a great feeling about it .
and you know , my life has been about winning .
i’ve won , and my life has been about winning , and that’s what i want to do for the country .
and if people say about my company and deals and you can do this deal or that deal , i have no interest .
it’s like the other day – _UNK_ , she’s doing so great .
`` dad , we can buy this wonderful office building and i said , `` _UNK_ , who cares ?
how can you talk to me about such trivial things , _UNK_ ? ''
it’s amazing .
see ?
now i’m dealing in trillions .
i’ve never heard of trillions before .
you know , with this – we owe $ 19 trillion .
we just signed a budget that’s so bad and the republicans – you know , we know where the democrats are coming from .
but these republican politicians , they go to washington and they’re going to end obamacare , which i’m going to do by the way – i’m ending , i’m _UNK_ , it’s going to be _UNK_ and replaced with something much better .
but they go to washington and they’re going to do this and they’re going to do budgets – like i heard the guy before `` we’re going to work in the budget . ''
it’s all about that .
what happens is they’re going to do budgets like we’re going to do this and that and i tell this story – then they walk into the capitol building , which is magnificent , and they look up `` _UNK_ , oh my , look at those _UNK_ , look at the ceiling , look at the _UNK_ .
oh , look at these magnificent floors . ''
they’ve never seen anything like it .
`` we’ve arrived .
this is incredible . ''
and then they become _UNK_ .
`` we’ll vote on obamacare .
yes , i vote . ''
they don’t want to leave .
they lose all of their courage .
i want to use a nice word because otherwise they’d get reported for _UNK_ language .
they lose all of their courage and they’ve let us down .
that won’t happen with me .
so , again , you’re not going to support me even though you know i’m the best thing that could ever happen to israel and i’ll be that .
i know why you’re not going to support me and you know you’re not going to support me because i don’t want your money .
isn’t it _UNK_ ?
no , it’s true .
you know , if i wanted to have your money , i think i’d have a _UNK_ good chance and i think i’d get more money than anybody else .
do you know the money i have turned down ?
this has not been my life turning down money .
guys want to give me millions .
i would have made – poor _UNK_ bush , i mean , this poor guy with his low energy .
it’s _UNK_ .
no , it’s _UNK_ .
i came up with that term , it became so defining .
it’s like having it on his _UNK_ `` i am low energy '' .
no , no , it’s _UNK_ .
he raised $ _UNK_ million , which means he’s controlled _UNK_ , _UNK_ controlled by the people that gave him the money .
that’s why you don’t want to give me money , okay ?
but that’s okay .
you want to control your own politician .
that’s fine .
good .
fine .
think about that , folks .
don’t worry about it .
i understand .
hey , five months ago , i was with you .
who’s better than me ?
who is better than me ?
i gave $ _UNK_ to the republican governors association .
i never even gotten a letter of thank you .
it’s true .
$ _UNK_ .
i didn’t receive one letter , not one letter from one governor .
_UNK_ .
the good thing is i don’t give any – why would i give any more ?
you don’t get a thank you letter .
politicians – remember this – politicians forget , politicians generally aren’t _UNK_ , and the one thing they are good at is getting elected and that’s what you’re going to end up having .
but i would love your support but i don’t want your money .
i appreciate it .
now , let’s take some questions .
okay ?
good .
_UNK_ going to go there right after this .
i have to go through – you know , you have to watch to make sure that the contractors aren’t _UNK_ and _UNK_ you off and everything else .
but to show you how important this forum is and how important the country is to me and how important israel is to me , it’s so important , i don’t mention my projects .
it’s not like very important to me anymore .
what’s really important to me is the united states and making it great again .
my _UNK_ is make america great again .
i mean , it’s taken off like _UNK_ .
the _UNK_ – it’s going _UNK_ .
but you know , some of these guys try to _UNK_ it but i had it _UNK_ because we’re smart .
a couple of them got up .
no , you see , i was making this speech and everybody stood up – make america great _UNK_ but nobody stood up to them .
but we sent them a little notice – don’t use that term .
we’re _UNK_ .
can you imagine i got the approval ?
but we are – we’re building a great _UNK_ down the road .
i hope you all stay and it’s going to be _UNK_ _UNK_ i was _UNK_ yesterday by a whole group of reporters from _UNK_ and they did a very good job .
very fair story .
and one of the questions was about israel and the palestinians what’s going to happen .
i said – i used that as an example of some deals that are maybe the hardest deal ever in history to _UNK_ we think of any deals ?
we all have tough deals , right ?
you know , we have some good , some _UNK_ but i said people are going to have to make sacrifices one way or the other .
i believe – because i’m a _UNK_ – i believe that i can put both sides together .
but i said , _UNK_ take six months .
at the end of six months and maybe sooner – with us we have a deal instinct .
a lot of us .
and you can walk into a room and you can almost tell like in two _UNK_ whether or not you’re going to make a deal .
i will know very quickly whether or not i’ll be able to put that deal together .
i used that in this _UNK_ as an example of perhaps the hardest deal in history to put together .
there’s probably no tougher deal .
if i could do that , it would make me so happy because there’s so much violence , so much death , and just been going on for so many years .
now , i said you have to have a commitment to make it .
i don’t know that israel has the commitment to make it , and i don’t know that the other side has the commitment to make it .
with that being said , you know , i have a good chance of winning because you look at what’s going on .
so i have a good chance .
i don’t like to as a _UNK_ give away a lot of cards by talking about how i feel about this or that .
i’d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room .
i don’t want one side or the other saying .
look , i think people know where i stand .
but wouldn’t it be great if they could make a deal ?
but a lasting deal , a real deal .
not a _UNK_ deal that’s going to last a week and then bad things started happening again .
i’d love to – and i will give it .
you know obama , as you know he said it won’t happen , meaning he gave up on this before it even started .
but i think it would be a great thing for israel – i think it would be a great actually for both sides if a real deal could be made , and i’m going to give it my best .
i’m a great _UNK_ .
that’s what i do .
i made a lot of money .
i’m going to give it my best .
it would be great if that deal could be made .
_UNK_ by the way , israel has given a _UNK_ a lot of people don’t know that .
i think the public relations for israel hasn’t been so great because israel’s given a lot but hasn’t been given a lot of credit for what they’ve _UNK_ in fact , some things have been given which were unthinkable and a lot of turmoil it caused in israel .
there were things given .
but i’d like to go in with a clean _UNK_ and just say let’s go , everybody’s even , we love everybody , and let’s see if we could do something .
but i do think this – and i do think right from the beginning and that one of the reasons i’m saying it now even though perhaps it comes back to _UNK_ me later on it has to be said that israel has given a lot .
i don’t know whether or not they want to go that far in a little step and you know that’s going to be up to them .
but israel has not been given the credit that they deserve for what they’ve done .
i will say that .
i will say that .
so that’s it .
you know what i want to do ?
i want to wait until i meet with _UNK_ .
you know , i’m leaving for israel in a very short period of time .
i know .
i know what you’re saying .
i just – you’re not going to be – who’s the wise guy ?
do me a favor .
just _UNK_ .
okay ?
you’ll like me very much , believe me .
okay ?
and you wonder why you get yourself in trouble .
all right ?
you’re going to like me very much .
it’s going to be fine .
but again , you can’t go in with that – if you’re going to make a deal and you could make a great deal – you can’t go in with the attitude we’re going to _UNK_ it down .
you’ve got to go in and get it and do it and do it _UNK_ so _UNK_ happy .
don’t worry about it .
you’re going to be very happy .
okay ?
don’t worry about it .
i think he’s a very good man .
i think he’s been treated very badly .
i think that our president has been _UNK_ _UNK_ to _UNK_ .
i don’t know how many people like _UNK_ .
but i think he’s been _UNK_ _UNK_ .
and – i mean , we’ll talk about deals after the fact , which is a shame but i think the iran deal is the worst single thing .
perhaps _UNK_ go down – and i’ve been pretty good at _UNK_ things .
i think it’s going to go down as the worst single thing that’s ever happened to israel .
i think it’s a catastrophe for israel .
and i think the fact that obama was willing to make that deal for anybody that loves israel to support this guy or even the democratic party is impossible to believe .
i think it will be one of the great _UNK_ .
but if i get in , i will _UNK_ it out , believe me .
it’s going to be _UNK_ out .
it’s going to be _UNK_ out tough and it’s going to be _UNK_ out fast .
the one bad thing is if i get in , the $ 150 billion is gone .
that hurts me and that hurts the people of israel .
but the $ 150 billion is gone because _UNK_ be gone before you get there .
you know , we’re talking about a year and more actually .
although the election very quick .
you know , it’s coming up .
it’s now less than a year and you know we have the iowa starts on february 1st and then we go right down the line and it’s very exciting .
we’re talking about a couple of months now for it to start .
for a person like me , i mean , it’s very exciting .
well , i haven’t been working too much with the arab leaders , to be honest with you .
okay ?
you know , i told you i made _UNK_ for _UNK_ .
i don’t know if that’s going to help me in the negotiation .
i can tell you .
you know , i’m trying to keep it nice and level , right ?
then i get people screaming at me .
but i’m trying to keep it as level as possible but i for the most part don’t know .
the king of jordan seems like a nice man .
i mean , i don’t know .
we’re going to see .
a lot of people like him ; some people don’t .
but i think i will probably be able – what my history – you know , i took some heat because i get along with democrats , i get along with _UNK_ , i get along with _UNK_ , i get along with republicans .
i get along with everybody .
that’s what i was – i’m a _UNK_ .
i get along with everybody .
we have to get along with everybody .
and i took some heat and i always explained that .
i said , `` wait a minute , i’m a _UNK_ .
i’ve got to get along with everybody . ''
i live in manhattan .
it’s all democrat .
i mean , it’s virtually all – republicans don’t even run people for the most part and if they do they get 5 % .
you know , they get a very small percentage of the vote .
got to get along with everybody .
i think that’s going to be a tremendous asset because right now we have gridlock in washington .
we have people that – they don’t talk .
you know , i remember that years ago because i’ve been a very political person on the other side but always very political .
but years ago , the republicans and the democrats – they used to like each other .
they’d get along .
they’d have dinner together .
they’d argue and they’d fight and they’d disagree and would have , you know , different views and things .
but in the evening , they’d go out and they’d have dinner together with their families .
you don’t see that anymore .
there’s total hatred and there’s total gridlock .
i’ll give you one point , which i think is important .
corporate _UNK_ .
right ?
so you have companies leaving the united states and they’re leaving because of better taxes and better a lot of things .
a lot of things are better .
but they’re leaving .
_UNK_ .
how good is _UNK_ ?
thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be lost .
but they’re also leaving because we have $ 2.5 trillion at least – i think it’s a much higher number than that .
$ 2.5 trillion – that’s out of the country that these companies can’t get back because of bureaucracy and _UNK_ trade agreements but because the taxes are too high .
they’re so _UNK_ that nobody in this room would agree to pay that much money to get your money out .
so they leave it over there and they actually take the company and they move the company to the money because that’s how much money .
the republicans and the democrats _UNK_ agree that the money should come back .
for three years they can’t get a deal .
there’s no leadership .
it’s gridlock .
there’s an example of something where everybody agrees – all the people that you see up here they all agree but they can’t get it done because they’re politicians .
they’re all talk ; they’re no action .
so there’s something and it’s so important .
it’s not like something where they don’t get – like there’s big disputes and we understand that .
this is something everybody agrees – the money should _UNK_ into this country and we should use the money and all the things – taxes paid .
but they agree and they can’t get it _UNK_ because of gridlock and _UNK_ leadership .
you know , honestly , i don’t think anybody can say .
she says she is .
but now she says all of a sudden maybe less so than you thought because she’s going very , very far over to the other side .
i mean , _UNK_ _UNK_ has brought her to positions that she didn’t want to be at .
you look at some of the things that she’s saying right now .
but i’ll tell you what , whether she is or not , she doesn’t have the strength or the energy to help israel .
i’m telling you she doesn’t .
_UNK_ just take a look .
_UNK_ come out and do an event and you don’t see her for another four days , three days , five days .
no , it’s true .
think of it .
we don’t need – some people say it’s not nice to say .
she doesn’t have the strength or the energy .
israel needs more than just our support .
they need strength .
they need real power behind them .
because you know , you look at as these countries fall over there , israel’s looking more and more – you know , israel has some difficulties .
and one thing and i think you’ll all admit it .
these people are fighting really dirty but they fight a lot better than we used to think .
right ?
we used to think `` oh , that was easy . ''
15 years ago with my friends from israel because i have a lot of friends from israel , they used to smile and _UNK_ `` oh , don’t worry about it . ''
now they’re saying , `` these guys are – they’re dirty fighters . ''
and they’re not bad .
you know , they’re tough .
they’re not the _UNK_ .
okay ?
obama said they’re the _UNK_ .
they’re not the _UNK_ folks .
we need tough .
we need general george patton .
we need general _UNK_ .
we don’t need the guys we have .
i see them on television – generals .
i don’t want my generals on television saying `` well , isis is very tough . ''
i saw a guy the other day .
isis is very tough .
i don’t know .
i don’t need that .
do you think general george patton – they don’t like him because he was a _UNK_ _UNK_ vicious _UNK_ brilliant guy .
so he would never make it .
they probably would have had him thrown out years ago .
but we need patton .
we need a genius like _UNK_ .
and we have those people .
we have those people .
i’ll find that person .
but we’re going to knock the _UNK_ out of them , i’ll tell you what .
we’re going to win .
we’re going to win .
we’re going to win .
well , i think radical islam right now is , and i feel that’s the greatest .
and again , we have a president who refuses to use the term .
but radical islam is – i’ll tell you one thing i know isn’t is global warming .
that’s the one _UNK_ know isn’t .
i mean , we have a guy that just the other day who said – here they want to blow everything – this is right after paris .
they want to blow our cities up .
they want to destroy our civilization , and he’s worried about global warming , which a lot of people think is a _UNK_ .
by the way , i won so many environmental _UNK_ _UNK_ .
no , it’s true .
and you know what i want to do ?
i want really _UNK_ air .
i want clean , _UNK_ water .
i want a lot of things .
okay ?
i want a lot of things .
but global warming – you noticed they changed the name – they go global warming , they go climate change , they go – now i hear a lot of extreme weather .
how can you miss with extreme weather , right ?
if it’s cold , it’s okay .
if it’s _UNK_ , it’s okay .
if it’s _UNK_ , if it’s _UNK_ – everything is extreme .
so now they use extreme weather .
it is a _UNK_ what’s going on .
and to have this man _UNK_ us by standing up and saying that global warming is our biggest threat , we got to get him out so fast and thank goodness we only have a year left .
thank you .
thank you very much everybody .
_UNK_ a great honor .
i want to thank _UNK_ and _UNK_ , one of the most magnificent _UNK_ .
for years and years , i’ve heard about _UNK_ and _UNK_ being a _UNK_ – i was going to say the _UNK_ , i was going to say the harvard or the _UNK_ , but they really are a great one .
and i want to thank you very much .
you’ve given us such tremendous support .
and we did this quickly and i think we did it very effectively .
it’s been an incredible experience .
we wrote a book and the title – `` crippled america '' – is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and i think one of the reasons we’ve been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is .
we tell the truth .
and america is crippled .
we owe $ 17 [ trillion ] and now $ 18 [ trillion ] and now it’s actually very soon going to be $ 19 trillion in debt .
we have a military that doesn’t have proper _UNK_ from leadership .
we don’t know what we’re doing .
we’re losing all over the world with trade deals .
every country , no matter what country you talk about , you can just pick a name out of a _UNK_ , they’re _UNK_ us in trade .
and we can’t go on like this any longer .
it’s impossible to go on like this any longer .
i always mention as an example sergeant _UNK_ , a _UNK_ .
we get sergeant _UNK_ ; they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly .
and that’s not the way it’s going to work anymore .
so we write about it in the book .
we tell _UNK_ of different stories of _UNK_ of different things .
and i think it’s going to be very _UNK_ , very important .
to me , it was _UNK_ .
when i did `` the _UNK_ of the deal '' , i think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely _UNK_ .
even today when i speak , so many people hold up the book `` the _UNK_ of the deal '' and the other books we’ve done .
so this is one that probably not since the _UNK_ of the deal , i have to tell this to _UNK_ and _UNK_ and _UNK_ , have i worked so hard on a book and it was in a _UNK_ period of time .
we wanted to get it out really , really quickly so that it _UNK_ to what’s going on right now .
it’s a moment of time .
and we got it done .
and david did a _UNK_ _UNK_ all of my people did a great job .
they helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now .
so this was not easy getting this in .
but we see by the lines – the lines go down to park avenue .
they’ve been _UNK_ since last night and i’m going to be signing books starting at 12 _UNK_ we’re doing a couple of _UNK_ and then we’re signing books starting at 12 _UNK_ and _UNK_ be very exciting for me .
but we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours .
i don’t know how they’re doing this but they do it .
they find a way .
so i’m looking forward to getting to the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ well , i think it’s a different book .
you know , we just had polls come out today from iowa where i’m leading .
you saw the new poll from iowa .
you saw the new poll in new hampshire where i’m leading big .
a poll just came out in florida where i’m leading big .
georgia , texas .
i mean , all over the place .
and i think you know look we’re doing well .
and if you add ben and myself we’re _UNK_ everybody by a lot .
that seems to be the big story that we’re _UNK_ – they call it the _UNK_ .
it’s called really the failed _UNK_ because the _UNK_ has let us down .
but i don’t know .
i don’t know how his book is doing .
well , i think my book is very _UNK_ .
his is a different kind of book and he’s a different kind of a person .
my book is very _UNK_ .
it says it like it is .
and based on what _UNK_ and _UNK_ just told me , it’s selling like _UNK_ .
so we’ll see .
we’re very different people .
we have very different qualities and we are extremely different .
and i’m different from all of the other candidates .
look , nobody can negotiate trade deals like me .
we are going to take the $ 400 billion a year that we’re losing with china , that’s going to be turned around .
the $ 75 billion a year that we’re short on with japan .
the $ 50 billion a year that we lost to mexico .
and that’s right , there will be a wall built .
it will go up .
it will be built .
and people will come into the country legally .
so i mean , much different than – you’re look at _UNK_ _UNK_ – very , very weak on illegal immigration .
you look at ben and he’s very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of medicare .
i mean , ben wants to get rid of medicare .
you can’t get rid of medicare .
_UNK_ be a _UNK_ thing to get rid of .
it actually works .
you get rid of the fraud , waste , and abuse .
it works .
so when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of medicare , i don’t know how he stays here .
no , i think that really _UNK_ is _UNK_ .
and frankly had bush been a better _UNK_ , he has the better message .
i mean , if that was me delivering that message it would have been a much different story because he hasn’t been able to – _UNK_ doesn’t show up to the united states senate .
he’s _UNK_ the people of florida , which by the way that poll just came out today and i’m way up in florida over everybody .
but _UNK_ is a sitting senator and he doesn’t show up for the people of florida , and i don’t think he should be doing that .
now , bush gave a very weak message .
i agree with that .
it was poorly delivered .
but the facts are on _UNK_ side and ultimately i think _UNK_ going to be hurt very badly .
and if you look at mr. _UNK_ , you have to see where mr. _UNK_ is coming from and when you see where he’s coming from , i think people are going to say , `` _UNK_ , we didn’t know that . ''
but look at _UNK_ _UNK_ on illegal immigration .
it’s really trouble for him .
i don’t see how he can win .
_UNK_ _UNK_ personal finances are _UNK_ you have to do is look at his credit card .
i mean , he is a disaster with his credit cards .
and i’ll tell you what , i love florida .
i’m in florida all the time .
and for years , i’ve been hearing that his credit cards are disaster .
i would think that when you take a look at it , you would find that .
but his credit card debt and his problems with credit card and what he did when he was running the party _UNK_ with credit cards , i’ve heard about it for years .
you’ll have to find out .
well , he has a very bad record of finances if you look at what happened with his houses , with his – you know , he certainly lives above his means .
there’s no question about that .
_UNK_ tell you what .
on the debates , it’s very interesting .
because i don’t really care that much .
i want a room .
i want a _UNK_ .
and let’s get going .
because i don’t really care that much .
but a lot of the people that are candidates who i respect – many of them , not all of them – but i respect many of them , they felt it was very unfair because hillary clinton was given all _UNK_ _UNK_ .
i mean , she wasn’t asked one tough question .
they didn’t talk about her foundation .
they didn’t talk about any of the problems .
they didn’t talk about the emails .
when the _UNK_ problem came up , _UNK_ _UNK_ lost his whole campaign .
i mean , what he did was so _UNK_ from his _UNK_ .
in order to get a _UNK_ _UNK_ of some applause , he gave up the emails .
that was end of his campaign .
first of all , people aren’t going to his _UNK_ anymore .
he’s finished .
so unless something happens to her with respect to the emails , _UNK_ easily be the candidate .
but i will say this : she only got _UNK_ .
that’s all she got .
and if you look at the way we were treated , it wasn’t the same way .
with that being said , i don’t really care .
well , i think the republicans actually are doing a pretty good job overall .
they _UNK_ at that last debate because i mean , it really started with me .
the guy asked me a question .
i think _UNK_ is probably finished as a credible reporter .
he’s a disaster .
and he was – it was such as _UNK_ put question and so obvious .
and the republicans _UNK_ around each other .
it was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it .
and all we want to do is to be treated fairly .
but with me , i don’t care that much .
just give me a _UNK_ .
what i would say is this : the networks have made a fortune because of me , not because of anybody else .
you know , they were saying that the last cycle , they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didn’t even want to _UNK_ it because nobody watched .
okay ?
nobody wanted to watch .
now , they have 25 million people , 24 million people , 23 million people and 16 million people .
i mean , give me a break .
so somebody said , `` how did they get there ? ''
and actually variety and _UNK_ reporter , who do report this stuff pretty well – much better than the political press – they said `` solely for one reason – it was trump '' .
i’ll take the credit .
but i’ll tell you what i also want .
i think that wounded warriors and our veterans should be given some of the enormous profits being made on these debates – enormous profits – by the way beyond anything they’ve ever _UNK_ .
cnn was going to get $ 2,000 for a 30 second ad .
they ended up getting $ 250,000 .
so they went from $ 2,000 to $ 250,000 for a 30 second ad .
the networks and the cable are making a fortune , and i think they should give some of the profits to the wounded warriors and the veterans .
that’s what i want .
i’m giving them away .
i’m giving the profits of my book – i’m giving them away to a lot of different – including the vets .
_UNK_ have been amazing with respect to the hiring of women .
this building was built as the head person who was _UNK_ by a woman and that was at a time when you didn’t see that in the construction _UNK_ .
i mean , it was _UNK_ unique .
i have many , many executives _UNK_ and in different buildings that i have that are women .
many – a proportion that’s close to 50 % .
might even be over 50 % if i analyze it .
and they get paid a lot of money – in many cases more than men doing the same job .
so women have always _UNK_ that about me .
i’ve been in terms of employment really a _UNK_ and i’ve been honored for doing so well with women .
what _UNK_ bush was saying at the last debate ?
i don’t know .
but he didn’t say it well .
_UNK_ like _UNK_ by the way .
i like it better than _UNK_ .
i’m _UNK_ _UNK_ for $ 500 million .
_UNK_ the country is doing so poorly .
it’s a very accurate title because the country is doing so poorly .
that’s good .
they’re going to have some _UNK_ .
oh , good because _UNK_ get even higher ratings if they do that .
i think it’s fine .
i think they should demonstrate .
ratings will go even higher than they are going to be .
it’s going to be one of the highest _UNK_ shows ever .
and they’re very excited about it .
and i have a great relationship , as you know from _UNK_ , with the _UNK_ .
you’ve treated me actually very fairly .
won the poll recently in nevada .
won other polls .
and in nevada , i think i got _UNK_ % and leading everybody .
so i have a great relationship with the _UNK_ .
i have working for me thousands right now – thousands of _UNK_ .
i’ve had tens of thousands of people over the year working for me .
i’m a job machine .
i’m a job machine .
and one of the things that does come out in every single poll and every single survey is that nobody for the economy nobody is even close .
i’m two , three , and you see that – two , three , four , five times greater than anybody else .
and you’d almost say like it’s about the jobs , it’s about the economy .
then _UNK_ anybody going to beat trump in all fairness ?
but i’ve had a great relationship with the workers .
i’ve had a great relationship with jobs .
and i’ve had an amazing relationship with the _UNK_ .
and i _UNK_ that i’m going to win the hispanic vote .
i think i’m going to win the hispanic vote .
i _UNK_ , yeah , i think i’m going to get the nomination and i will win the white house .
i think _UNK_ hillary clinton is going to be easy because her record is so bad .
that’s the question i like .
how am i preparing for my _UNK_ ?
well , i’m meeting with _UNK_ _UNK_ in a little while .
_UNK_ , we’re going to sign – i guess got thousands of people on line but we’re going to sign and then later on this evening i’m meeting with _UNK_ _UNK_ and the whole staff and we’ll start the preparation .
we’ll pick our _UNK_ .
am i nervous ?
not too nervous .
not too nervous .
but we’re going to do a good job and we’re going have a _UNK_ show .
we’re all going to have a lot of fun .
my _UNK_ _UNK_ ?
no , i don’t want to do that .
i don’t like showing a person _UNK_ at the _UNK_ .
tom is asking `` can _UNK_ make a _UNK_ ? ''
i think it’s going to be very hard .
very hard .
not about money .
i just think – you know , i came up with the energy .
and i just think we need tremendous energy because we need a person that has tremendous personal energy to get us back on track .
you can’t do that when you don’t have that .
i think _UNK_ is highly _UNK_ .
highly _UNK_ .
he doesn’t have it and all you have to do is look at his _UNK_ on things .
_UNK_ – he _UNK_ the quality that you need .
we’re talking about everybody in the world is _UNK_ us off .
you need a very strong person with tremendous energy .
thank you very much folks , i’ll take the job .
but and it’s so important .
and by the way , ben _UNK_ does not have that energy .
we need somebody with tremendous energy to _UNK_ out the military , to _UNK_ out isis , to _UNK_ out our _UNK_ trade deals , to _UNK_ obamacare and come up with something far better for far less money .
you need somebody with tremendous personal energy as president .
we have a president right now that doesn’t have energy .
i mean , you think obama has energy ?
he has no energy .
and he’s been a _UNK_ president .
we need somebody with great personal energy as a leader so that we can make great deals with other countries and do well in every other respect .
and certainly _UNK_ does not have that energy in my opinion .
from the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , they treat me very _UNK_ in _UNK_ .
go ahead .
well , we just went over that .
honestly , we just went over that .
and it’s only going to make it harder .
you’re going to see what we’re going to do .
you’re going to see .
but the whole thing with anchor _UNK_ , i turned out to be right .
a person has a baby , lives in mexico or lives in asia or lives in many different place , has a baby , walks across the border , has the baby here .
now , we’re responsible for that person for the next 85 years .
i don’t think so .
and by the way , i was right , they were wrong .
the _UNK_ amendment does not give them _UNK_ on that .
and if you wanted to do that in mexico or if you wanted to do that in almost any other country where you have a baby in that country and that country has that person for 85 years including all of the costs of that person , they would _UNK_ you right out of the country .
you would be _UNK_ out of the country so fast .
so , that turned out – i was 100 % right .
we’ll have to worry about that .
we’re going to take care of it , and it’s going to be done in a very _UNK_ way .
but we’re going to bring back our country and we’re going to have a wall and mexico’s going to pay for the wall and you know why they’re going to pay ?
and i have great relationships with mexico and _UNK_ relationships with the mexican people .
_UNK_ .
and they buy _UNK_ from me ; they work for me by the thousands – by the thousands .
_UNK_ relationships .
but let me just tell you we lose so much money with mexico in terms of trade _UNK_ – $ 45 billion last year .
plus , we give mexico billions and billions of dollars .
they will pay for the wall .
and it will be very interesting .
and you know what ?
people are going to come into this country but they’re going to come in legally .
_UNK_ lot of european countries are going to build walls to stop the immigration .
well , walls work .
all you have to do is ask israel .
walls work if it’s properly _UNK_ .
not the walls that these _UNK_ , these politicians that we have running our country who are a _UNK_ – all talk , no action politicians – they build a wall this big , they drive cars right through it .
walls work .
all you have to do is go and see israel .
they will tell you that walls work .
we need _UNK_ and circumstance .
our country has no spirit .
our country has no _UNK_ .
our country doesn’t feel good about itself .
and the primary reason is we have no victories .
i mean , where have we had a victory ?
where have we had a victory in trade ?
where have we had a victory as an example this _UNK_ deal that was signed with iran where we’ve given them $ 150 billion and we lose everything .
we lose everything .
it’s a _UNK_ stock .
worst deal .
worst _UNK_ i’ve ever seen drawn .
we have no victories .
and i do write about it .
we need some _UNK_ and circumstance .
we need spirit .
we need a _UNK_ .
i thought seven years ago when obama got elected , the one thing i thought that he would be a great _UNK_ for this country .
he’s not .
he’s been a great _UNK_ for the country .
he’s been one of the great _UNK_ of all time .
i’m not saying _UNK_ .
it has nothing to do with _UNK_ .
it has to do with the fact that what he says is very divisive .
he has been a great _UNK_ for this country , and that should not have happened .
_UNK_ go anyway they want .
i don’t care too much about the debates .
look , i’m the one that gets all the _UNK_ questions anyway .
nobody else gets the really _UNK_ questions .
in a certain way , maybe they’re defending me although i will tell you they’re not doing it for that reason .
i think it’s _UNK_ .
i just – i like the debates .
i’ve had the debates .
i’ve done well in the debates .
as you know , every single poll said i won all three debates .
now , i don’t know if i did or not but i certainly didn’t do badly .
but every single poll says – even _UNK_ poll said i won the debate .
so i like the debates .
i think they’re good for me .
but we have to be treated a little bit fairly .
as an example , hillary clinton – no tough questions .
i mean , why didn’t they ask about bill ?
why didn’t they ask about all of the different things .
no tough questions .
now , that was _UNK_ by the democrats .
and frankly , they did a very smart thing in the way they _UNK_ it .
well , we’re going to stage something properly also .
but as far as i’m concerned , i really don’t care that much .
i just want a debate .
i think debating is a good thing .
it’s healthy .
gets everything into the open .
but you don’t want people like _UNK_ that read a question – _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ – that he wrote – that he carefully wrote .
he thought he was such – his career – in my opinion , his career is probably _UNK_ or certainly threatened .
he could ask about anything you want .
i mean , you have to ask about anything you want .
hillary had only _UNK_ .
all night long .
it was like this – `` here , hillary , hit this one out of the park . ''
are you from russia ?
all right .
i think our relationship with russia will be very good .
_UNK_ putin was on 60 minutes with me three weeks ago .
right ?
putin .
and they have one of the highest ratings they’ve had in a long time .
so i’m going to give him total credit .
but we will have a very good relationship i think with russia .
now , maybe we won’t .
but i believe we will have a very good relationship with russia .
i believe that i will have a very good relationship with putin .
sounds okay to me .
well , i think there are a lot of economic issues .
we didn’t talk about trade .
we didn’t talk about _UNK_ .
right ?
we didn’t talk about corporate _UNK_ , which by the way , none of the other candidates , they don’t even know what it means .
but we didn’t talk about corporate _UNK_ where companies are leaving our country – massive companies – because they can’t get their money back and because they get lower taxes elsewhere .
so they’re leaving and they’re taking their jobs with them .
the corporate _UNK_ _UNK_ is a very important thing to be talking about .
these were all things that weren’t talked about at the debate .
instead , they talked about _UNK_ football .
i mean , it was a big question – _UNK_ football .
i’m saying what about corporate _UNK_ ?
$ 2.5 trillion at least .
i think it’s probably twice that number is in other countries wanting to come back and because our system is so corrupt and terrible , they can’t get the money back to invest in this country .
so they don’t talk about corporate _UNK_ at the debates .
they talk about _UNK_ football .
those are the few .
i was against the war in iraq .
you know , it was very early on .
i’ll give it to you .
yeah , i have it _UNK_ well , you know , you have to understand , i was a _UNK_ .
a lot of people didn’t care about my view in 2003 and _UNK_ but there was a _UNK_ article taken from a magazine about my _UNK_ in _UNK_ , i believe , in july of _UNK_ and it talked about my _UNK_ on how i felt about iraq .
and i said very strongly exactly what happened .
i said you will _UNK_ the middle east and when you _UNK_ the middle east , iran will take over iraq .
that’s exactly what’s happening .
and they will take over the oil reserves , which are among the largest in the world , and in addition other bad things will happen .
the other bad things are isis .
i said that in _UNK_ and that was an article that was taken from a magazine which was previous to that .
i’ve felt that for a long time .
_UNK_ i think that it’s time for some of the other republicans in the race that _UNK_ zero – in a couple of places they have a zero with an _UNK_ pointing left , which i assume is a mistake because that’s less than zero .
i assume that’s not happening .
do i think it’s time to have some of the other republican candidates drop out ?
yes .
there are too many people .
well , i don’t want to get personal but you can look at the poll numbers .
look , if a person is campaigning for four or five months and they’re at _UNK_ % or 1 % or 2 % , they should get out .
like , you know , look at me .
i go to florida and look at the numbers that just came out in florida .
_UNK_ % ?
georgia .
i mean , those are real numbers .
these numbers that these people have – and i often ask myself .
i asked mark yesterday , `` what are they doing ?
do they do this for their brand ?
because i happen to think it’s very bad for their brand . ''
i think [ scott ] _UNK_ did a good thing .
i think the way _UNK_ – he saw it wasn’t happening , wasn’t going to happen and he just got out quickly .
you know , he was _UNK_ .
don’t forget .
you know .
that was before trump was going to happen .
right ?
but he was _UNK_ for a period of time .
_UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
they thought he was going to win .
what happened is he got out .
i think the way he got out was great .
i think he did a really smart thing for himself .
and frankly , other people should get out because i would like to personally have more time to talk about the problems of the united states and more importantly how we can solve the problems .
so it’s a great question .
people should get out .
_UNK_ .
oh , they just said one of the biggest applause lines – it’s true – i get is when i talk about my daughter _UNK_ .
she was just at fortune magazine for like something like woman of the year which is _UNK_ _UNK_ is going to be very involved and _UNK_ is going to be very involved very soon .
they’re going to be coming out very soon .
oh , _UNK_ is going to iowa .
when are you going to iowa ?
very soon .
i would say – i don’t see threats .
i mean , whatever it is i have to do .
mark is saying `` what are the top threats to your _UNK_ ? ''
who knows ?
i mean , you’re in the _UNK_ world of politics .
people change their minds .
i’m going to make america great again .
nobody else is going to be able to do that .
i’m going to do it .
i’m going to make it in my opinion better than ever before , and i think that’s _UNK_ tough to compete with .
and one of the reasons that in my book i actually put _UNK_ in there – i showed some of the _UNK_ that – i have many , many more because you can only – _UNK_ and _UNK_ – you actually kept me to eight or nine pages .
right ?
and there are four or five in a page .
but i show some of the great _UNK_ that i have done that are so successful and so incredible and so _UNK_ good , i show my financial statement from a year and a half , two years ago .
now it’s even better but we didn’t have that _UNK_ yet .
so i do that not in a _UNK_ way .
i do that because that’s the kind of thinking our country needs right now .
we are run by people that are _UNK_ .
we are run by people who in so many words – i hate to use the word _UNK_ but you have to use that word .
unless they have bad intentions which i don’t believe they do .
but we are run by _UNK_ people .
we have _UNK_ leadership .
there are so many things .
like i mentioned corporate _UNK_ .
the democrats want the money to come back .
who doesn’t ?
the republicans want the money to come back .
for three years , the democrats have said we want the money to come back .
for three years , the democrats and the republicans agree 100 % .
you have a vast majority .
maybe everybody .
for three years .
guess what ?
they haven’t done anything .
right ?
they can’t even get along when they agree .
so here’s the thing where we can take trillions of dollars , bring it back to this country , rebuild big parts of our country with it , companies can spend that money in our country , we have everybody agrees it should be done for years and they can’t do it .
that’s a part of the problem .
well , you’re going to look – a lot of controversy with mr. _UNK_ .
a lot of controversy with mr. _UNK_ .
there are those people that probably wouldn’t have want him to back .
but we’ll see .
i’ll talk to you .
no , they all agree .
they all agree .
they just didn’t want to go through the unfair questions because they weren’t questions ; they were statements .
you see , they were asking – they were giving statements in a _UNK_ , _UNK_ way .
and by the way , i think _UNK_ is terrific and i think carl is terrific .
but i think john _UNK_ is not very good at what he does .
but i think _UNK_ quick is a terrific person .
i think carl is a terrific person .
but i will tell you john _UNK_ was a _UNK_ to _UNK_ .
_UNK_ question is should the fed raise rates ?
they are not raising them because obama has asked them not to raise them .
in my opinion , he wants to get out of office because we are in a bubble and when those rates are raised , a lot of bad things are going to happen or potentially going to happen .
and in my opinion , janet _UNK_ is highly political and she’s not raising rates for a very specific reason because obama told her not to because he wants to be out playing _UNK_ in a year from now and he wants to be doing other things and he doesn’t want to see a big bubble burst during his administration .
janet _UNK_ should have raised the rates .
she’s not doing it because the obama administration and the president doesn’t want her to .
and if she does it , you see what happens every time there’s even a thought of raising them just a little bit .
and one of the problems that we have is our currency right now is not competitive with other _UNK_ .
because if you look at the _UNK_ of china , of japan , of many , many different countries , they’re making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we don’t have leaders that know how to say to china , `` don’t do that .
don’t do that .
because if you do that , we’re going to put a big _UNK_ tax on you .
don’t do that . ''
and you know what ?
if you said that , they wouldn’t do it .
if you have the right _UNK_ i’m really focused on one very big election , one very important election , and there are some pretty good elections .
i’m not watching any of them in particular .
i’ll be watching them on tuesday night .
but i’ll be out there ; we’ll be out voting .
but the election that i’m watching is the election for the presidency of the united states .
that is going to be in my opinion this will be truly one of the most important elections we’ve ever had in this country .
we’re so far behind .
and we can not go another four years with _UNK_ leadership .
that’s a good question .
okay .
so , _UNK_ and _UNK_ came up to me .
they wanted to do a book .
they wanted to do on success and how do you do this and how do you build it and that’s what the book is largely about but we talked so much about the country .
and i said , `` i’ll do it but we have to talk about the country . ''
what happened is they sent this incredible _UNK_ up to do a book cover , do to a picture .
and he did some _UNK_ .
i’m smiling .
i’m happy .
i look good .
everything was fine .
and then he took one where i wasn’t like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a _UNK_ picture .
and then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture i had was that one .
it’s a terrible , _UNK_ , _UNK_ picture .
but when you’re talking about `` crippled america '' and you’re talking about all of the problems we have , i can’t have a big _UNK_ face up there .
so that’s how we picked it .
we picked the worst photo taken of me .
i would have loved to have a beautiful smiling picture but somehow that doesn’t go with the title of the book or frankly the content of the book , and actually _UNK_ and _UNK_ agreed with me .
okay ?
are the other republicans afraid to debate ?
well , some of them should be .
thank you very much everybody .
thank you .
_UNK_ was telling some of the folks backstage , i never ever thought we’d do this well this fast .
this has been so incredible .
what’s happened all over .
what’s happened in iowa .
it’s been really incredible .
we’ve had some amazing results and they continue to come in .
got a little _UNK_ in iowa .
i don’t know what’s going on .
somebody said `` are you going straight to new hampshire ? ''
now , i love new hampshire .
we’ve got great numbers .
_UNK_ to _UNK_ that’s good .
but we fell a little behind in iowa , and some people are saying how can it be .
and i come out and i was just telling a group we have the biggest crowds , we have the most _UNK_ crowds .
everybody said and it’s very true .
i mean , look at this .
somebody else would come , they’d have like 50 people and they wouldn’t need this room .
believe me .
but everybody said without question in every poll – this isn’t just here – that the people that are with trump are with trump .
they don’t go anywhere .
they’re staying .
it’s true .
i see it .
i see it .
and we’ve seen it .
you know , a couple of times i say `` well , that could be the end . ''
then they do something and i’m 10 points up .
it’s the _UNK_ thing , right ?
but we’ll take it .
but they say the people are with – we have the most loyal people by far .
everybody says it .
the other thing they say is for leadership , number one .
very important , right ?
don’t you think ?
leadership .
i mean , when leadership is number one – they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot .
so you know it’s great .
i thought i’d talk a little bit and i want to take some questions .
you know , we can do a little question and answer .
right ?
we have all these cameras going back here .
and you know , it’s always tough when you’re on live television all the time .
look , we have 10 _UNK_ .
right ?
how many _UNK_ ?
10 ?
how many different ways can you talk about the 10 _UNK_ ?
the bottom line is we want results .
we want to get it done .
but when you’re on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then you’re talking about immigration and you’re talking about the wall because we’re going to have a wall and we’re going to stop illegal immigration .
but we talk about trade and we talk about _UNK_ obamacare .
and we talk about all the things that we talk about .
but you know , you have these points and we could talk about them in different forms , in different ways and give different examples .
but in the end , it’s really about results .
isn’t it ?
it’s really about results .
and you can only talk about the same _UNK_ on live television so many different ways .
i talk about industry .
i talk about commerce .
i talk about how we’re losing our jobs to all of these different countries .
and i give different examples .
but it’s still going to be a certain number of _UNK_ .
i talk about second amendment .
i talk about _UNK_ amendment .
we talk about _UNK_ .
you know , that second amendment , they want to take it away from you .
they really want to do things and it’s not going to happen .
it’s not going to happen .
at least with me it’s not going to happen .
that i can tell you .
so i said today you know we’ll talk for a little while but i want to do some questions and answers .
i want you people to _UNK_ me for a change .
is that okay ?
i want to be excited .
and so we’re going to have some fun .
we’re going to do that .
a few things – i want to bring up a few new _UNK_ .
so , immigration , we’re going to be doing a very strong number .
it’s killing us .
it’s killing us .
and it’s bad for the economy .
it’s bad for – all of this illegal immigration .
and i have to tell you legal – you come in and we’re going to have a good time and you’re going to be there and you’re going to do great – and visas – maybe work , maybe there are cases where you need people in and we’ll do something , we’re not going to hurt our economy in any way , shape or form .
we’re going to make our economy much , much stronger .
but we’re also going to get jobs for people that are here .
people with us .
we’re going to get jobs .
we’re going to get jobs .
but the illegal immigration – you know , i did this and i made my determination – i took a deep breath .
because i’ll tell you what , it takes courage to say i’m going to run for president .
it really does , especially in my case where i have a great business and i love my business .
i love doing it .
i may never even see it .
i mean , i own some of the great _UNK_ in the world .
_UNK_ in miami .
i may never see it _UNK_ _UNK_ in _UNK_ , one of the greatest homes of the british open and all of that .
i may never see it again .
all of these incredible places that i have .
but more than that , it takes courage because when you do it , you’re putting yourself out there beyond anything that _UNK_ done and it even takes courage for a politician to do it .
now at some point some of these guys have to leave .
don’t we agree ?
it’s getting _UNK_ .
because like tomorrow night we’re having a debate , and i wish we had more time for the debate .
not in terms of three hours because who wants three hours ?
you know , i could stand up for 20 hours if i had to but who wants to watch that long ?
_UNK_ debate essentially _UNK_ for an hour and a half and i was – oh – it was – you couldn’t watch it .
you have hillary against a _UNK_ .
and honestly , he’s not going to win .
just so you _UNK_ not going to win and neither is _UNK_ well , she’s being _UNK_ protected because in theory she shouldn’t even be allowed to run .
she’s being protected .
it’s a tough game and it’s a _UNK_ game but she’s being _UNK_ protected .
but she’s going to beat him and you still have one more of these guys .
_UNK_ .
so he’ll be out quickly , i guess .
i don’t know what’s he doing .
what do they do when they have zero ?
they have zero .
and i wouldn’t say it against our folks .
but they’ve treated me – some of the _UNK_ have treated me so _UNK_ , right ?
because they want to start controversy and they want to try pick up some points .
and you know what ?
i’m not going to even mention names .
usually i do .
i love doing it .
but everybody that’s hit me so far has gone down .
they’ve gone down .
and they’ve gone down _UNK_ .
and a couple of the ones and _UNK_ – they’re the ones that hit the hardest .
i mean , they’re like desperate people .
but they hit .
one of them has a zero with an _UNK_ pointing to the left .
that means less than zero .
and i don’t understand .
what does it mean ?
i assume it’s a _UNK_ but maybe not .
but when you look at the things that are happening with our country – the trade situation with not just china – i talk about china all the time because that’s the main _UNK_ , that’s the biggest _UNK_ .
the numbers are _UNK_ .
almost $ 400 billion a year in terms of _UNK_ .
think of it – $ 400 billion a year .
and they send stuff over here but we can’t send stuff over there .
they tax us .
big tax .
a friend of mine can’t get stuff over there .
the tax is so big .
big tax .
somebody bought an _UNK_ in china here .
can’t get it over there .
_UNK_ guy .
rich guy .
bought a beautiful plane .
can’t get it over there because the tax is so massive that he’s now selling in this country because china won’t let him have the plane and he has to pay a tax .
i won’t even tell you what the tax is .
it’s so _UNK_ that i don’t even believe them myself .
so i’m not going to say it because those guys will say `` well , he was wrong . ''
all i can tell you is it’s a massive tax .
like you don’t buy planes here because if you do , you won’t be able to get them back in .
and here , we accept all of their products .
so we have almost a $ 400 billion trade _UNK_ with china .
we have a $ 70 billion trade _UNK_ with japan .
we have a – you know , with all that’s going on in the south china sea and you look where we have a _UNK_ – a _UNK_ small ship – over there , i don’t know if i’d want to be the captain of that ship right now .
but they’re being sort of _UNK_ and _UNK_ and a lot of bad things can happen .
but you know , we have an agreement with japan and i love japan .
i love china .
i love all these people .
but their leaders are killing us because they’re smarter , _UNK_ , more _UNK_ .
the leaders of mexico are killing us at the border and in trade .
they’re taking so many of our companies .
even _UNK_ – my _UNK_ – they’re taking _UNK_ .
right ?
i’m never eating _UNK_ .
i tell it all the time .
they had some _UNK_ before on the plane and i said i don’t want to touch them .
bring them back .
i _UNK_ out to bring them back .
but i’m not happy .
they’re leaving chicago and they’re moving their big plant to mexico .
so when you see this happening , we have to stop it .
and i’m not going to beat around the bush and `` oh , let’s talk and let’s be nice and let’s say – `` nobody can do it like i do it .
nobody .
honestly , nobody .
we can – i’m not saying i’m perfect because i’m not perfect .
_UNK_ _UNK_ now , _UNK_ perfect .
but i’ll tell you when it comes to that stuff i’m really – there’s nobody better .
carl _UNK_ _UNK_ me the other day .
he’s one of the great _UNK_ , one of the great _UNK_ .
he says trump , trump .
and he’s not somebody that just do it .
he wants somebody that knows what they’re doing .
he understand .
you talk about corporate _UNK_ and all of the things that have been going on .
corporate _UNK_ .
you know , many of the companies in this country have trillions of dollars _UNK_ .
they think $ 2.5 trillion overseas right now .
they can’t get it in .
and everybody agrees that we should bring it in .
the democrats and the republicans .
they’ve agreed for years .
they can’t make a deal because they have no leader .
it’s not like `` oh _UNK_ , we disagree on obamacare .
or we disagree on something else . ''
although i must tell you many of the democrats that i speak to because i’m friendly with all of them .
i’m friendly with like republicans .
i get a long with everybody .
you know , everybody says `` oh , you won’t be a _UNK_ '' .
i’ll be the greatest _UNK_ of all .
why is obama a _UNK_ ?
but i will tell you many of the democrats who voted for obamacare would never have done it now and were _UNK_ to _UNK_ times .
right ?
`` you can keep your doctor , keep your plan , keep your this , _UNK_ going to be great . ''
turned out to be a total lie .
_UNK_ different times that they know of and they wouldn’t have done it .
but when you look at what’s happening with corporations and the highest tax – we pay the highest tax anywhere in the world of any country – but they have trillions of dollars overseas .
and these are great companies in many cases .
they have thousands of employees .
they can’t get their money back .
and the reason is bureaucracy .
it’s very hard .
and also big reason the tax is too high .
they don’t want to bring $ 1 million back and pay $ _UNK_ or $ _UNK_ tax .
they’d rather leave it over there .
and if they bring it back , they’ll be using it to invest in our country .
i mean , a lot of good things will happen .
i happen to believe it’s more than $ 2.5 trillion .
but here’s the thing and i use it because it’s so incredible .
here’s the thing .
it’s not controversial .
it’s not like you have the republicans here and you have – everybody agrees .
they’ve agreed you know that for 2.5 , 3 years .
they can’t make a deal .
and now what’s happening and this will be the next great story is companies are leaving the united states – two reasons – lower taxes but also to get their money .
they’ve got billions of dollars overseas .
they’re leaving our country in order to get their money and in order to pay lower tax .
and you’re talking about one company i know of – i don’t know how much they’ve written about it – but you’re talking about _UNK_ jobs just one company .
you’re talking about potentially thousands of companies .
and i say it , in the old days , they’d leave new york .
people would move down and companies would move down to florida or they’d move to texas or they’d leave new jersey , where taxes are quite high , and they’d move to another _UNK_ .
right ?
now , they leave our country and they go to other countries .
that’s what’s happened .
in the world of the internet and the world of very fast _UNK_ , it’s a different world out there .
and there’s no loyalty .
they’re paid a lot of money to make a lot of money for their shareholders and some of them are actually foreign ; they’d like to move back to these countries .
they bring in executives that are from ireland , from other places .
and they don’t mind .
they don’t have loyalty to the united states .
so my plan , my tax plan , is something i’m very proud of .
we’re going to solve corporate _UNK_ .
i’ll tell you what , we will have that money back – if i get elected president , that money will be back so fast your head will _UNK_ .
nobody else will be able to do it .
nobody .
honestly , nobody else even knows about it .
the other candidates , most of them don’t even know about it .
it’s not their _UNK_ .
okay ?
it’s not their thing .
it’s not their thing .
their thing is getting _UNK_ .
that’s what they’re good at .
they get _UNK_ .
and they make promises and they’re all talk and they’re no action .
and the same things happen with these politicians .
it’s always the same .
so we have so many different things and what i’ve done with our tax plan , which something i’m very proud of , we’ve brought it down to a few groups .
because right now , you have to go out – people who aren’t doing well go out and hire companies to help them with their tax plans .
they’ll pay $ 500 , $ 1,000 because it’s so complicated .
and we’re going to make it nice and simple .
and we’re getting rid of carried interest , which is something that a lot of rich hedge fund guys love .
but we’re getting rid of it .
they don’t love me so much anymore .
but i don’t care .
and we’re getting rid of a lot of things .
so we’re going to have a nice simple tax return .
somebody said `` oh , why isn’t everybody paying ? ''
you know , 40 % – a big percentage – will not pay any tax at all .
people that are doing badly .
they said – well , i won’t use the _UNK_ name because i don’t want to insult any candidate when they can’t defend themselves .
they said `` we want everybody to pay at least something . ''
and i said , `` i agree . ''
here’s the problem .
from the _UNK_ of _UNK_ , from the _UNK_ of bureaucracy , you’re talking about millions and millions of returns .
you’re talking about building the irs even bigger and it’s a _UNK_ .
and i could cut it down way down .
and the money that you’re talking about is far less than the administrative costs .
so i said , `` i agree .
except for one thing from a practical _UNK_ , it’s too much .
most of these people aren’t paying anyway . ''
what i want to do is bring our jobs back from china , bring our jobs back from mexico , bring fairness to our deals as an example with japan .
i was in los _UNK_ .
ships – the biggest ships you’ve ever seen .
cars are _UNK_ off into this country .
made in japan .
we give them _UNK_ nothing .
the balance is so bad .
the _UNK_ is so bad .
and then we have all the strikes .
see , what our people don’t know and only somebody that wrote `` the _UNK_ of the deal '' or does this stuff .
it’s natural .
it’s like a great _UNK_ .
like a jack _UNK_ .
he was always able to _UNK_ that _UNK_ .
right ?
you know , he’s just better .
and you have _UNK_ – very few – but there are some people that have a certain ability .
a lot of people don’t even know we have all the power .
we have all the power in china .
you know , we owe right now china and japan equally $ 1.5 – think of this – trillion .
$ 1.5 trillion .
think of this .
they take our business and in the case of japan , mostly cars .
but they take our business .
they take our jobs .
factories close down all over the place .
and we owe them money .
right ?
it’s a magic act .
for them not for us .
for us it’s a horror show .
it’s going to end .
it’s going to end .
and people like carl _UNK_ and the people like the best negotiators – i know the best negotiators in the world .
some i think are _UNK_ people .
i’ll be honest with you .
i don’t care .
do you care if they’re _UNK_ people ?
who cares ?
now , carl happens to be actually a very nice guy but he’s a brilliant _UNK_ and a tough _UNK_ and he’s built a fortune .
he doesn’t want money .
he doesn’t want to say , `` oh , give me $ 200,000 a year in government money . ''
he wants to do it .
he’s proud to do it .
he wants to help the country .
and it’s so easy for him .
for instance , if i say `` carl , do me a favor .
the trade deal we have with china is so unfair we’re losing $ 400 billion a year .
carl , do me a favor .
make it fair . ''
i don’t have to give him a big speech .
i don’t have to give him a big speech .
i mean , i can tell you that within a very , very short period of time , things will _UNK_ out .
i mean , things will _UNK_ out and it’s going to be our benefit .
but think of it , if we’re losing that kind of money – that _UNK_ .
it’s an _UNK_ .
some people will say `` that’s not really a loss . ''
it is a loss .
if we have that kind of _UNK_ and _UNK_ you brought it back to zero or even if we lost $ 100 billion a year , that’s a lot of money .
believe me , i couldn’t sleep .
if i brought it to $ 100 billion a year , get rid of me in four years , all right ?
but _UNK_ we brought it back to $ 100 billion or we brought it back to zero , do you know what that means to this country ?
do you know the kind of money you’re talking about ?
then jobs will start coming back , _UNK_ of good things would happen .
_UNK_ of great things would happen .
and maybe our _UNK_ who have all these _UNK_ all over the place , maybe they’ll have 75 % and maybe they’ll like them better .
maybe they’ll be better .
and they’ll be manufactured here .
whenever i order television sets , i ordered thousands and thousands of television sets a year for different jobs .
and whenever i order them , they all come from south korea .
they make all the television – other than sony but sony has sort of lost its way a little bit .
sony is japan .
but south korea – _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
i don’t get _UNK_ from american .
i’d love to .
i’d love to .
george will said there’s a company in south carolina that makes television .
i said where are they ?
i’d like to have a good name too by the way .
it’s important .
you know , when _UNK_ paying you a fortune for a _UNK_ room , it’s nice to see a good name .
right ?
do we agree ?
well , it’s a company in south carolina but they don’t make them there ; they assemble them .
they’ll order parts that come in and they’ll assemble them .
but much different .
but i’d love it if we made them .
but you take south korea .
we defend south korea for essentially nothing .
you have the _UNK_ over in north korea that nobody ever talks about by the way .
now , he really has nuclear weapons and we don’t talk about him .
we made the worst deal ever made with iran .
right ?
the worst .
these are the people that represent – these people are _UNK_ .
or _UNK_ .
somebody said , `` you shouldn’t say _UNK_ .
it’s not nice . ''
but it’s true .
they’re _UNK_ .
i think .
i mean , i think .
unless i don’t know is there something going on that we don’t know about ?
think of it .
point after point , we lost .
we lost everything .
we’ve given them $ 150 billion .
hard to believe .
they don’t have to develop – i was telling somebody they don’t have to develop nuclear weapon ; they can buy it .
what the hell why should they develop it ?
they can buy it .
and now all of a sudden they’re going into syria .
they got so much money .
they’re a terrorist state .
they’re going into all of these different places .
we’re fighting them in yemen and yet we’re making a deal with them .
so why don’t you say `` hey , yemen out '' ?
our prisoners – i want them back .
i want them back .
i don’t want them over there .
i want them back .
and all we have to do , very simple , is if you have the right _UNK_ .
i’m the right _UNK_ .
you know , i’ve gotten to a point where i have to be _UNK_ .
it’s terrible .
right ?
because i can’t be so nice and say `` we can all do a wonderful job '' .
people can’t do those kind of stuff .
for instance , the wall .
i said , i guarantee you that we’re going to build a wall .
it’s going to be a real wall .
we’re going to have people come through and they’re going to come through legally .
or they’re going to come through with visas , which is a safe way , if we need it .
and we want people to come through .
i want people to come through .
i don’t want to say no .
but we have at least 11 million – you know , the _UNK_ thing is nobody has any idea how many .
you know , we’ve been hearing that number for years .
you know , like 11 million .
we have no idea .
i spoke to one of the top people .
they have no idea .
might be 5 million .
might also be _UNK_ million .
could be 50 [ million ] _UNK_ but we have to get them out .
we have to – look , it’s harsh .
dwight eisenhower – we all like dwight .
right ?
remember the expression .
right ?
i go remember he got elected – `` i like _UNK_ '' .
how could he be bad ?
all right ?
and i think he was a _UNK_ general than _UNK_ and patton .
and i like _UNK_ as a president but i love patton and i love general _UNK_ .
i love them .
and we’re going to find ourselves a patton and we’re going to find ourselves because we have a lot of smart guys in our military and women .
we’re going to find ourselves a _UNK_ we’re going to find a patton and we’re going to find a _UNK_ .
and i’m really good at that .
we’re going to find great people .
and i’ve told this story where i watched these generals go on television – they shouldn’t be on television .
they shouldn’t be talking .
you know ?
they shouldn’t be talking .
they should be doing .
and they asked a certain general , i’m not going to insult him .
it was like a month and a half ago .
on a show .
a talk show .
i said here’s general so and so , one of the top , top , top people .
i said what’s he doing on television ?
and he’s saying `` well , isis is very tough .
you know , they spread out . ''
by the way , they took the oil that i said take .
remember i said `` take the oil '' ?
always take the oil !
they’re being funded by the oil that i said take .
i don’t want their _UNK_ oil .
but you know what ?
it turned out to be another benefit of having it .
take the oil .
and we didn’t do it .
we shouldn’t have been in iraq in the first place .
and i said that in _UNK_ shouldn’t have been there .
we _UNK_ _UNK_ the middle east .
we _UNK_ _UNK_ it .
but we were there .
then obama _UNK_ because he’s so _UNK_ `` we are leaving on a certain date in a year . ''
right ?
i couldn’t believe .
i was sitting there thinking `` did he really say that ? ''
he said `` we will have all troops out by a certain date . ''
right ?
did he say that ?
i said `` no , no , tell me please . ''
_UNK_ , you know what another one i got high marks on from every poll ?
military .
they think i’ll be the best in the military because they say i – you know , i always say i’ll be the greatest jobs president that god ever created .
i will .
but everybody knows that , especially god .
everybody knows that .
but you know what i’ll be ?
i’ll be the great at the military .
i’ll be so good .
and i’ll know when – and i’ll build our military so strong , so tough , so incredible , _UNK_ going to mess around .
we’re never going to have to use it .
we’re never going to have to use it .
and i’m going to take care of our vets .
believe me , they’re our greatest people and our vets are not being treated as well as illegal immigrants .
i’m going to take care of our vets .
so go back .
so the world is _UNK_ .
i made a business deal a year ago .
and the guy – oh , i beat him so badly .
_UNK_ , it was so beautiful .
it was a beautiful thing .
it was like a picture .
for me , it was like a picture .
that’s my own problem .
i guess .
but to me it’s like a _UNK_ when you could do something like that .
so i made this deal and it was great .
and they called .
they did a story on me recently and it was a nice story .
and i said , i hope they don’t call this guy .
they ended up calling this guy `` what do you think about trump ? ''
and he said but in a respectful way , he said `` he won because he was so _UNK_ _UNK_ .
we don’t know what the hell he was going to do . ''
that’s a positive .
that’s a positive .
i mean , if you’re a _UNK_ _UNK_ and you’re _UNK_ , you’re not going home with much money .
okay ?
but it was really – i said , `` that’s not nice what he said . ''
first , i said `` that’s not nice .
i’m _UNK_ . ''
then i said , `` wait a minute .
he meant that as a _UNK_ . ''
and i called him .
i said , `` what did you mean by that ? ''
he said `` i think that’s the greatest _UNK_ i can pay .
we could not figure you out .
you came at us from 15 different _UNK_ . ''
so with obama , when he _UNK_ that we’re leaving iraq on a certain date , we shouldn’t have been there but once you announced the bad guys – you know how they say the surge worked ?
you know why the surge worked ?
you know why ?
because the bad guys all moved back .
they said , `` hey , what do we have to get killed for ? ''
i mean , these people don’t mind being killed , can you believe it ?
but they said `` if we don’t have to , let’s not . ''
so they moved back .
and they said , `` hey , they’re leaving in - '' what was the date ?
do you remember the date ?
specific date to the day .
`` we will have all troops out .
i’m a great president . ''
so the bad guys , meaning the opponents , whatever you want to call them , they just said , `` oh , you’re leaving in a year .
going to have all the troops out .
let’s go back .
why do we have to be shot at for the next year ?
and what do we have to do because if we do well maybe he’ll change his mind and stay .
so let’s let him think he has this great victory with the surge . ''
right ?
`` the surge worked ! ''
what happened was that everybody pulled back .
they said , `` let’s wait . ''
now we leave because of a lack of leadership .
we leave and boom it comes apart .
that’s what happened .
that was the surge .
everybody talk so much – `` oh , the surge was so great . ''
the surge was great because everybody knew – they knew what was happening .
they knew it was going to happen .
they knew we were leaving even through bush .
i mean , honestly , they knew we were leaving .
they were fed up .
so they pulled back and they said , `` let’s get them out . ''
everybody wanted to leave .
now , i would have done it differently .
even if i wanted to leave and i might or i might not .
i won’t even say .
people say , `` mr. trump , what’s your attitude on isis ?
when will you attack them ?
where ?
i say `` you know , i don’t want to talk – i have a real chance of winning .
i don’t want to tell you what my attitude .
i want them to guess .
i don’t really want to tell you . ''
i mean , the one bad thing about our system , we have a system that got flaws .
let’s face it .
hey , look at our leadership , it’s got flaws .
but you know the one bad thing ?
when i gave that answer , they say – although some people – i see it here – some people say `` we love that .
we love that . ''
but when i give that answer , some people say `` oh , trump doesn’t know .
he doesn’t know .
he didn’t give an answer as to exactly what he’s going to do .
exactly what he’s going to do . ''
and i know exactly what i’m going to do and eventually after i was asked the question by 10 different reporters , all of whom are here tonight by the way , i said , `` you know , here’s the problem .
if i don’t give the answer , i’m not going to win because they write so incredibly _UNK_ .
so if i don’t give the answer , i’m not going to win . ''
they’re going to say `` trump wouldn’t give us the answer . ''
they don’t know it’s _UNK_ .
they don’t know it’s strategy .
and i said for a period of time like a month , i said `` i don’t want to tell you because i actually have a chance because from the time i announced , i’ve been on the top of the polls , almost at the top .
you know , we’re doing well . ''
iowa , will you get your numbers up please ?
would you get these numbers up ?
i promise you i would do such a good job .
first of all , i am a great christian and i am .
i am .
remember that .
and i do well with the _UNK_ .
but the _UNK_ left me down a little bit just last month .
i don’t know what i did .
but i am a great christian .
i’m a _UNK_ and i believe in the _UNK_ .
and i even brought my _UNK_ a month ago to a group signed by my mother , mary , and with the address and the date – i won’t tell you what date it was because possibly you’d think i’m younger than that .
but she didn’t want anybody taking my _UNK_ because that was very important to her .
so _UNK_ .
she has the address , has the date .
but i said to myself , `` you know – `` by the way , before i forget , will you get the numbers up iowa please ?
this is _UNK_ .
i mean , what is my competition ?
in all fairness , in all fairness , what is my competition ?
do you think these guys – i’m not going to say _UNK_ – i’m not going to say _UNK_ , who really is way down – i mean , i am second .
it’s not like it’s terrible .
but i don’t like being second .
second is terrible to me .
but do you think that ben is going to go to china ?
these guys are fierce .
like they’d come into your office .
i’ve made many deals with china .
i’ve had great victories in terms of deals with china .
they come into your office .
there’s no `` hello .
how are you ?
it’s a wonderful day . ''
they come in – `` we want deal . ''
there’s no games .
i do this for a living .
i’m really good at it , folks .
really good .
and you know , when you talk about energy , i’ll tell you one thing , everybody agrees – oh , do i have energy .
oh .
i _UNK_ and turn thinking about how i’m going to make the best deal for you folks .
i’ll be _UNK_ and turning .
i will be _UNK_ and turning .
you’re going to have so many deals that is so good for you .
we’re going to have numbers are going to be so good .
i always joke you may get tired of them but then i always take that back because nobody gets tired of winning .
we don’t win anymore .
you know , think about it .
do we win at all ?
ever ?
we lose with the military .
isis beats us .
everybody .
we lose with trade .
when are we going to come back and say , `` we beat china '' on a deal ?
when are we going to come back , `` we beat japan '' ?
do you know that everybody said `` oh , japan .
they have so power over us .
they have so much power because we owe them $ 1.5 trillion and they send all those cars . ''
they have no power .
if we ever say , `` listen , if you’re not going to treat us fairly , we don’t want your cars anymore '' , they’d go out of business , folks , they’re gone .
same thing with china .
china is not even doing that well .
but they just _UNK_ , they just _UNK_ their currency .
the biggest in two decades .
and the reason they did it , they could never thought but we have so many other problems that they felt , `` oh _UNK_ , we can get away with this and it’s going to make it impossible . ''
did you see the results yesterday of _UNK_ _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ .
because they’re not getting stuff out because everybody – japan and china in particular – is _UNK_ their currency .
that’s their number one weapon .
and the _UNK_ trade deal that we’re making doesn’t even cover it .
that’s their number one weapon and the trade that we’re making doesn’t cover it .
so i only say this and you know what ?
people might say `` it’s terrible .
he’s a terrible person , a terrible human being .
but i’m going to vote for him _UNK_ . ''
okay , that’s fine .
i’m actually a nice person .
i always say this – nobody can do this stuff better than me .
and i know all the guys i’m running against .
they’re wonderful people .
some of them i really like .
but who cares ?
i was talking to one of the candidates the other day .
i was talking about corporate _UNK_ and they didn’t even know what the hell i was talking .
they had no idea .
it’s not their thing .
and unless we stop all of the things that are going with other countries and unless we make great trade deals , we’re being _UNK_ alive .
that’s why when you look at the _UNK_ numbers , we have 100 million people in our workforce that aren’t working .
our real unemployment rate is probably 30 % .
it’s not _UNK_ % .
that was done for politicians so they’d look good .
it’s not _UNK_ % .
how can you have _UNK_ % when you have 100 million people ?
you look for a job .
if you’re a young guy , that _UNK_ young guy with the red hair , right _UNK_ if he comes out and he goes into the workforce and he looks for a job and he goes through college and does well and then he can’t get a job and when he gives up because at some point after months you give up , they essentially consider you _UNK_ .
it’s the most _UNK_ thing .
we have a tremendous – tens of millions of people in that position .
they can’t find jobs .
they’re good people .
they want to work .
they can’t .
but it’s not reflected in the real numbers because the politicians want to look good .
so let me just before we talk some questions , i’m going to talk about something i’ve never really talked about it _UNK_ but we should talk about it .
it’s called _UNK_ _UNK_ .
it’s one of the great _UNK_ of all time .
it’s one of the great _UNK_ .
so we sent out – i think i had – and it’s not me .
people set them up .
and i don’t know .
maybe they’re setting up for my benefit .
let’s take me .
a guy sees me , likes me , sets up a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
i don’t talk to him .
i don’t do anything .
i think we had either 9 or 5 or _UNK_ we don’t even know .
they’re all over the place .
trump , trump – one of them called the _UNK_ of the deal _UNK_ after the book .
they have all these _UNK_ .
and the money comes in .
and what do they do with the money ?
i don’t know .
and we aren’t supposed to call them or anything .
okay .
so , we wrote a letter – a legal letter – to i think either 9 or 11 last week saying we don’t want their money , send it back because again , what do they do with it ?
if some guy that’s having a hard time all of a sudden has $ 2 million sitting in a _UNK_ _UNK_ , do you think he’s going to take ads for trump ?
maybe and maybe not .
so we sent them a – it’s a _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ , a _UNK_ .
it’s a _UNK_ that we have .
a _UNK_ .
and i’ll tell you i read a number with , as an example , with ben .
ben is paying 70 to almost 80 _UNK_ on the dollar to raise money .
so when you read he has all this money , he’s paying a lot of money and that’s not reflected yet .
so when you hear they raised $ 20 million , they’re paying – now think of it , who pays – the number i actually heard was _UNK_ but you know these guys will check them so i’m telling you it may be off but you all know it’s a lot .
i think they said , _UNK_ _UNK_ on the dollar .
think of it .
to raise the money , they take _UNK_ _UNK_ before they get to use the money for what it was supposed to be .
somebody is making a fortune .
i know in _UNK_ campaign , a couple of guys walked away with millions and millions of dollars .
millions .
they became rich raising money .
it’s better than being a real _UNK_ _UNK_ .
for the people and real _UNK_ _UNK_ , they take these massive _UNK_ of the money they raise .
it’s a _UNK_ .
it’s a _UNK_ .
now , in _UNK_ case , his _UNK_ _UNK_ is running iowa .
and let me tell you , the people that are running that _UNK_ _UNK_ , even if it comes in small _UNK_ , those are the real _UNK_ .
those are the _UNK_ .
in the case of _UNK_ bush , you’re not supposed to deal with these _UNK_ _UNK_ .
okay ?
so , it was in the wall street _UNK_ the other day .
he has a _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ or something in a _UNK_ and right next to it , he had his campaign _UNK_ .
did you read that ?
two _UNK_ .
one here , one here , right next to each other by coincidence , of course .
they’re not supposed to be coordination .
they’re not supposed to be talking .
they’re right next to each other .
and that’s nothing compared to what some are doing .
it’s a _UNK_ and it should be stopped .
and it’s unfair to somebody like me that is spending my own money .
and what happened and i haven’t talked about this before but i’m seeing what’s going on .
it’s _UNK_ what’s going on .
what happened is the last time they had the _UNK_ _UNK_ , i actually think there was sort of a wall .
you know , they called it the wall .
and this is a wall too .
won’t be as good as the one i’m going to build but it’s a wall .
but it was a wall and they didn’t deal .
i mean , even though like bush has a friend of his running his _UNK_ _UNK_ , i’m sure they never talk .
i’m sure .
what do you think the chances are that they talk ?
100 % or 99 % ?
100 % .
i’d say 100 % .
i’d say 100 % .
only a _UNK_ person would say 99 % .
but whatever .
they’re not supposed to .
but they put a friend in there .
they put other people in there .
they put whoever .
and that’s the way it works .
and in some cases , i hear in _UNK_ case , i hear in other cases , they’re literally running .
i mean , had _UNK_ done this in all fairness because he had money in the _UNK_ _UNK_ but he had no money in his campaign and he was unable to figure out this is what they’re all doing .
that’s why he’s out of the race because he couldn’t figure it out .
the whole thing with _UNK_ _UNK_ is a _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ .
so i sent letters last week to as many as we could find .
they’re all over the place .
we want you to close the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
we want nothing to do with it .
we don’t want to get _UNK_ .
we don’t want any of the money .
go home and _UNK_ give the money back .
they don’t even have to give the money back from what i understand .
they can keep it .
they’ll probably if they actually raised money for me , they’ll say `` what a _UNK_ thing he just said .
i think we’re going to support somebody else . ''
they could do that .
but the _UNK_ _UNK_ have total control over the people running for office .
total .
nothing over me .
nothing .
i feel it’s very unfair .
i feel it’s a very unfair situation .
now , if they want , they could have full _UNK_ and _UNK_ what are they doing with this whole thing ?
and i think it makes _UNK_ people out of people that might be honest .
but the _UNK_ _UNK_ are _UNK_ your candidates – some more than others .
some are _UNK_ .
and what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left .
when you read that ben raised $ 1 , how much is left after he pays all of the _UNK_ and all of these people , how much is left to spend in the campaign .
you’ll be _UNK_ .
i mean , it’s so little .
bush , it’s the same thing .
and i’ll go over – there are other names .
i know every one of them .
but it’s a _UNK_ thing that’s taking place .
and again , last cycle , at least they went through the _UNK_ .
now , they’re not even going through the _UNK_ .
they’re not even going through .
and just remember when i have to negotiate with companies to keep them in this country so they build jobs here and they build their plants here and their factories here and they do all of the things here , when i have to do that , you know , john _UNK_ , i paid them tens of millions of dollars .
you can even check .
i said to john _UNK_ , `` i want an _UNK_ . ''
i don’t know if they’ll give me an _UNK_ .
i’ll tell you if they don’t they’re not so smart .
i guarantee no other person gave john _UNK_ – i mean , i bought probably more than $ 10 million worth of john _UNK_ _UNK_ .
i love it .
you know why ?
iowa .
iowa .
i love it .
i love it .
when we can .
by the way , it’s a great company .
it’s a great company .
but i buy a lot of stuff from john _UNK_ because i have a lot of big _UNK_ that really require john _UNK_ type equipment .
i don’t have to buy it from them .
i could buy it from others .
but i want to _UNK_ it to them when i can .
but we have to do something to clean up this political mess because it’s _UNK_ stuff .
it’s _UNK_ stuff .
and it’s got to stop .
and it’s very unfair to people who go out and do it the way you’re supposed to do it , including me .
i think i’m the only one that’s _UNK_ .
i’m the only one putting up my own money , other than – i know it’s precious – people write in to _UNK_ or whatever and they send me checks like $ 20 .
i keep saying the woman for $ _UNK_ , $ 50 , $ 100 .
i don’t want their money .
but if you send it back it’s _UNK_ _UNK_ .
i mean , they always write letters too .
they write these beautiful letters – `` mr. trump , i can’t afford much and i know you don’t need it but i’m sending $ 50 because that’s so important what you’re saying about the country . ''
it’s beautiful .
i mean , i’ve seen such beautiful letters .
and if i send it back , there’s no letter i can write that’s not going to be _UNK_ to those people , really .
`` dear mr. so and so or mrs. so and so , i don’t need your money and thanks a lot but we’re going to do it ourselves . ''
if i got that back , i’d say `` who the hell does he think he is ? ''
so we take that and it’s something that i think is important .
so i always _UNK_ it by saying i don’t consider that funding but i’m _UNK_ my campaign and i’m getting ready to put up millions , millions .
and something i’m very proud of that i think it’s great and it’s you know really great , it hasn’t gotten very much _UNK_ , hasn’t gotten much _UNK_ , but i have spent less money than any other candidate .
okay ?
by far .
i think .
i don’t know , probably a couple of guys that have nothing so they just go _UNK_ i was told that i spend less .
and i have the best results because in most polls i’m number one .
now , until iowa came along , i said `` every poll '' , and then iowa – what the hell are you people doing to me ?
you know ?
you know ?
i’m telling you .
they said , `` why don’t you _UNK_ iowa ? ''
they told me that .
everybody said `` _UNK_ iowa '' .
all of the political _UNK_ .
a man just _UNK_ me back there , great reporter .
he’s actually a great reporter .
of course , if he _UNK_ a bad story , i won’t say that .
but he is .
he’s a great reporter .
and he said , `` would you ever think of maybe _UNK_ iowa going right to new hampshire ?
and then you’d go to south carolina '' where i’m leading by massive – yeah , you’ve got to see the _UNK_ there .
they’re incredible .
`` but you’d go to new hampshire .
you’d go to south carolina .
you go to nevada .
you go to the _UNK_ . ''
i said i can’t do that because i have such an _UNK_ relationship with the people from iowa that i think we’re going to win .
i really do .
i believe it .
i believe it .
and i don’t want to _UNK_ iowa .
i think we’re going to do well .
i think we’re going to do great with _UNK_ .
i think a lot of things are going to come out over the next period of time that are not going to be so good for our opponents , honestly , and i think i’m going to do great with the _UNK_ because i am the real deal .
i will tell you that .
i’m the real deal .
so i told these political _UNK_ , you know , i hate to say it but the last long number of elections on the republican _UNK_ , the person that won iowa did not get the nomination .
okay ?
i want to take away some of your _UNK_ .
you understand that .
so could we do – and please do me a favor ?
let me win iowa .
and then i’m going to win , i’m telling you we’re going to win new hampshire , and we’re going to win south carolina .
a great poll just came out on north carolina just a little while .
a _UNK_ poll .
it was great .
some of you saw that .
but great poll .
but we’re going to go on and we’re going to win .
we’re going to win .
and actually , one of the pundits – because you have some smart pundits and some very , very dumb pundits .
a lot of pundits said `` he’ll never run .
he’s not going to run . ''
they’re still trying to recover .
but one of the very smart one says `` if trump _UNK_ iowa , it’s over . ''
it’s interesting because it will go right through because everywhere else is so great .
and i thought it was good here .
come on .
okay , so that’s the end of that .
but i want to tell you , will you – i refuse to say `` get your _UNK_ in gear . ''
i will not say that .
i will not say it .
i will not say it because i don’t want to use anything that’s even a little bit off .
so will you please do me a favor and work with my people and go out on _UNK_ _UNK_ vote and give us a victory ?
and if i win iowa , we’re going to run the whole table and we are going to make such great deals and we’re going to have such a great military and we’re going to take care of our health care without that _UNK_ obamacare that’s a _UNK_ .
so , i’m _UNK_ with you people .
i’m going to spend money here .
i have a great team over here .
and i will tell you i’m going to spend a lot of time here and i really want to win iowa and i think we should and it’s so important .
and you know , it’s about time that iowa could have a victory and let that person go onto a total victory .
okay ?
not like over the last – right ?
so , i love you all .
i mean , we’re having fun .
but i love you all .
but i do mean it .
i’m going to stay here .
we’re going to work really hard .
when i heard the poll today , they said `` what are you going to do ? ''
i said , `` i’m going to work harder in iowa . ''
i’m not leaving iowa .
i’m not leaving iowa .
now , if i lose iowa , i will never speak to you people again .
that i can tell you .
okay , let’s do a couple of questions .
right ?
come on .
_UNK_ know , we have now and the numbers they just came out we have 50 million people in poverty in this country .
now , you look like you’re doing pretty well in all fairness .
but still , we have 50 million .
we have _UNK_ million people and they’re getting food _UNK_ .
_UNK_ million .
think of it .
you know , we talk about how well we’re doing .
so we have 50 million – almost 50 million each between poverty , food _UNK_ , and it’s got to end .
one of the problems – we don’t have enough jobs in this country .
it’s very simple .
you know , it’s so simple when you think about it .
our jobs have been taken away .
and i’ll tell you what else , middle income folks – their salaries haven’t gone up in 12 years .
people are making less wages now than they were 12 years ago .
and other things have gone up .
so they’re really doing much worse than they were doing 12 years ago .
but that’s an amazing _UNK_ .
but people – one of the reasons they say i’m doing so well because i let people know we’re going to bring jobs back .
we’re going to bring industry and plants .
we’re going to bring it all back and nobody else can say that .
we’re going to bring it back because a lot of the folks in this room are doing worse than they were 12 years ago and they’re working .
then the other thing , you have a lot of _UNK_ jobs .
i have some people that i know very well and they’ve had a job for 20 years at the same place .
all of a sudden they’re working _UNK_ because of obamacare because from an accounting _UNK_ , it just works better .
they love the owners , the stores and things .
they love the owners ; they think the owners are great .
but the owners are forced to make _UNK_ jobs ; they have _UNK_ jobs .
they work all their life .
they have a wonderful company that they’re working for , and now all of a sudden they’re cut into _UNK_ jobs because of obamacare because of the _UNK_ of obamacare .
and you all know what i’m talking about .
so they end up being _UNK_ workers and they don’t want to be _UNK_ workers .
they don’t even like the _UNK_ of being called a _UNK_ worker .
and we’re not going to have that stuff anymore .
we’re not going to have it any more .
we’re going to have real jobs and the numbers are going to go up .
believe me .
the numbers are right now worse than 12 years ago and that’s a shame _UNK_ you what , as president , i can guarantee it .
as trump , i can say i’ll probably be able to pull it off anyway because they know it won’t stop .
_UNK_ be easier to take todd and just say , `` look , we’re going to work with you , todd .
okay ? ''
so will you get me that number and everything and we’ll make sure that everything get – and somebody else – who else over here ?
you have problems with the va also , _UNK_ ?
terrible ?
i hear only – i just hear terrible .
and we’re going to solve that problem .
you know , it can be solved .
the _UNK_ now for the va are longer than they’ve ever _UNK_ _UNK_ now are worse than they’ve ever been .
thousands of people dying waiting for a doctor .
okay , dying .
and you find the same thing , you say .
you have to use your own because they won’t do anything .
so we’re going to take care of our vets and we’re going to take care of the va and it’s going to be one of the things we’re going to be releasing pretty soon .
but one of the things we’re going to do with the va , we have a lot of hospitals that aren’t doing any business .
we have a lot of private doctors that could do more business .
we’re losing a lot of our doctors because of obamacare .
they’re _UNK_ .
they’re leaving .
one of them – a friend of mine – said `` i have more nurses working for me now more than before but i have more accountants '' and the end result is a disaster ; he’s getting out of the business .
he’s got nurses but he’s got more accountants than he has nurses because the _UNK_ is so _UNK_ .
so one of the things we’re going to do is if todd or if you or if somebody has problems because of the wait – because the _UNK_ are _UNK_ – 5 , 6 , 7 days sometimes .
they’re going to a private doctor .
they’re going to go to a private hospital .
or a public hospital that’s in the area .
and we’re going to pay for that and it’s going to cost less money – it’s going to cost less money than the system we have now – and you’re going to end up getting much better care .
it’s going to cost less and you’re going to get better _UNK_ so the _UNK_ _UNK_ , first of all , i’d _UNK_ it because it’s thousands of jobs .
okay ?
i would _UNK_ it so fast , so fast .
and hillary should have approved it .
you know , hillary wanted to _UNK_ it but she’s been dragged so far left , that’s she’s – forget it .
it’s a disaster .
so i would _UNK_ it .
but with that being said , i may want to make a better deal because you know what ?
we’re bringing oil from canada .
right ?
i may say , i want 10 % .
we’re going to _UNK_ it but i want 10 % , 15 % .
because the truth is that the _UNK_ _UNK_ was better a while ago than it is now because we have so much because of new technology , we have so much energy _UNK_ our own feet with the _UNK_ and all of the other things that have emerged over the last five years , we have so much energy .
and it’s great stuff .
we have really great quality , higher than canada .
you know , they have the _UNK_ _UNK_ , which is a problem for them .
very expensive to get it out .
we have great stuff .
so i would _UNK_ it because i love the jobs of building it .
i love the jobs of building it .
but i may just say , maybe we should get 10 % , 15 % , maybe 20 % as that oil _UNK_ through our land .
you know , maybe we should do that .
so i’m going to look into that .
but when i _UNK_ it – i’ll tell you what , when i _UNK_ it , _UNK_ be a great deal for the united states .
it won’t be like – because right now , what we’re doing is we’re _UNK_ it , we’re not really getting anything .
they’re putting it underground , and that’s actually good _UNK_ .
better than having trucks going down the road and everything else .
that’s good _UNK_ .
but we’re not getting – we’re not getting – anything much for it .
when i get finished with the _UNK_ , they’ll be happy and we’ll be happy .
okay ?
well , i’ll tell you in all fairness , ben _UNK_ said yesterday or the other day that he wants to _UNK_ medicare .
okay ?
and you know what a disaster that is .
now , i’m sure at some point , he’ll take it back .
but he said he wants to _UNK_ medicare and one thing , people do like their medicare ; they do like it .
and you are bringing up a point that i’ve heard before .
we’re going to look at a lot of different things .
but we’re going to save social security , we’re going to save medicare and that’s the way it is .
okay ?
we’re not _UNK_ like other people .
okay , it’s a lot of people but you know what ?
it’s _UNK_ us $ 200 billion a year immigration in this country right now .
and dwight eisenhower is going to say he moved 1.5 million in the _UNK_ , early _UNK_ , moved them out .
we have tremendous illegal immigration problems .
dwight eisenhower , nice guy , he moved 1.5 million people out of the united states .
and you know what happened ?
he moved them right across the border and they came back and they moved them again and they came back .
they moved them a third time , they came right back .
and then you know they were tougher in those days .
they moved them all the way south – all the way south – and they didn’t come back .
now , we have to do it .
we have no choice .
we either have a country or we don’t .
and i want them to come back .
but i want them to come back with papers .
i want them to come back legally .
i want them to come back .
the good ones .
the good ones .
but only the good ones .
we got some bad ones .
remember the heat i took with illegal immigration ?
remember that heat ?
for two weeks .
rush _UNK_ said `` he has received more incoming than any human being i’ve ever seen . ''
and then he _UNK_ you know what ?
i took a lot of heat and then you had _UNK_ in san _UNK_ , killed , shot in the back and so many others .
and people started looking .
and let me tell you , we have some wonderful people over here and they’re here illegally but they’re wonderful people .
okay ?
and we’ll try to get them back real soon and we’ll do it through a legal process .
but we also have some really bad _UNK_ members .
you know , some of the gangs in la .
they’re made up of illegal immigrants .
and we have _UNK_ police forces that don’t get the respect that they should get .
they don’t get it .
i mean , what they go through , it’s _UNK_ .
they’re afraid to talk to anybody .
they don’t want to lose their jobs .
they don’t want to lose their pensions .
they can’t talk .
now , let me just tell you something .
you can always have bad _UNK_ .
in this room , we have a couple of bad _UNK_ .
okay ?
i don’t know who they are or where they are but you do .
probably mostly back there in the press .
but the police do an _UNK_ job .
and they know the gangs .
you go to la the la cops .
you got chicago , the chicago cops .
these people are amazing people if they would be allowed to do their jobs .
but they’re not allowed to do their jobs .
and we’re going to get the bad ones out of here so fast and they’re not coming back and i don’t want to put them in our _UNK_ because i don’t want to _UNK_ these various countries where they come from for the next 45 years .
i don’t want them in our _UNK_ .
we have hundreds of thousands right now in our _UNK_ .
i don’t want them in our _UNK_ .
i heard a couple of these candidates saying , `` well , they’re – `` they’re such _UNK_ .
but you know what ?
they’re talking about putting them in jail .
well , i don’t want them .
our _UNK_ are _UNK_ .
i want to use our _UNK_ for people that are supposed to be there .
okay ?
and i don’t want to put these really bad _UNK_ – i mean , they are bad – i don’t want to have to pay for them for the next 45 years .
okay ?
and we’re going to deal very _UNK_ with the good people and they are mostly good people .
but we’ve got some real bad ones and they’re out of here .
your head will _UNK_ probably .
somebody said the other day , `` what’s the first thing you’re going to do ? ''
well , we’re going to work immediately on _UNK_ obamacare .
you know , the one good thing about executive orders ?
the one good thing ?
you know , obama signed an executive order where everybody just come in .
come in .
we have great border patrol people .
i got to know them a couple of months ago when i went down to texas to the border .
they’re great people .
they’re not allowed to do their job .
they stand there and watch people walk right in front of them smiling at them .
they want to do their job ; they’re not allowed to .
so the executive order that president obama signed , the one good thing about an executive order , in the first minute in office , i will _UNK_ and _UNK_ those executive orders .
they’ll be _UNK_ .
the only good thing .
it’s actually the only good thing about an executive order is that a new president can just do a signature and that’s the end of that .
so we’re going to clean up our border .
we’re going to make it _UNK_ .
we’re going to be proud to be a country again and a lot of good things are going to happen .
we will support israel 1,000 % .
israel feels so left alone and i know _UNK_ and a lot of my friends are from israel and they feel so left out .
and so many people say , you know , i have so many jewish friends where they say why did i support obama ?
i think he’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to israel .
and we will support israel beyond anything they ever have before .
okay ?
that’s an easy one .
that’s the easiest question of the night !
_UNK_ wall is a big factor .
60 % , 70 % .
the drugs are a great question .
we are going to stop drugs .
look , i told you before – mexico – $ 45 to $ 50 billion .
that’s not including the drugs .
the drugs that are coming across the border are beyond belief .
did you see the picture last week where they had a little wall this big and they built a ramp for trucks to go over it with trucks ?
did you see the picture ?
they think we’re playing games .
and mexico is not helping us .
mexico is not helping .
do you know if you want to become a citizen of mexico – i love the mexican people .
i have many mexican people and _UNK_ working for me .
in nevada , i’m number one .
i’m _UNK_ number one in the polls with the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ shocked .
because the _UNK_ that are here legally , those people they want me , they know i’m going to bring jobs and everything else .
they don’t want people _UNK_ in .
but i will tell you mexico has got to help us .
you know , if you want to become a citizen of _UNK_ you know it’s one of the hardest countries in the world to become a citizen of ?
and yet , people _UNK_ right through into us , into us .
they call us the dumb americans .
that’s what they call us because of our leaders .
they call us the dumb americans .
if you want to become a citizen of mexico , you could take the best person in this room , the most qualified , you’re not going to do it .
they don’t do that .
and if you’re there illegally and if you _UNK_ your bound ?
you’re not going to be there illegally .
but if you have a pass for two weeks and you _UNK_ your bound , they have cops waiting for you .
they have police that say , `` you know you have one day left . ''
i hear it’s _UNK_ .
i’m impressed actually .
because to a certain extent , that’s the way it’s supposed to be .
but if you want to become a citizen of mexico , it’s impossible .
they don’t have anchor _UNK_ in mexico .
you’re born a baby in mexico , it’s like _UNK_ .
here , you’re born over here , `` oh , congratulations we’re taking care of the baby for 85 years . ''
not going to happen .
it’s not going to happen .
no , it’s not going to happen .
by the way , this is important , i sort of _UNK_ into this one .
the _UNK_ amendment .
it says right there – you know , everybody says you have to go through a whole process , _UNK_ take many years , you have to go through every state .
you have to do another amendment .
it’s wrong .
_UNK_ amendment _UNK_ it .
and some of the best legal minds in the world say `` trump is right . ''
i said , `` what ?
i am ?
i didn’t know . ''
i _UNK_ into it .
every once in a while you luck .
the fact is somebody comes in illegally and they have a baby , we’re not responsible .
now , we may have a court case but we’re going to win it .
and a simple act of congress gets rid of it .
and a lot of people didn’t know that .
okay ?
and the reason i said it can be possible because nobody could be _UNK_ enough to allow a thing like that .
how could it be possible ?
and we’re one of the only countries where that takes place .
and honestly , i use mexico as an example because they’re so tough .
if that happens in mexico , they don’t even know what you’re talking about .
what are you talking about ?
but with us ?
no good .
not going to happen anymore .
well , you know , the amazing thing is that the politicians in this country live by a whole different standard when it comes to health care , when it comes to everything they have including what you just said about social security .
our politicians live by a different standard and i think that shouldn’t happen .
and some of them tried to do it .
you know the story in obamacare , they don’t have to take it .
they live by a different standard .
and that’s not going to happen .
everybody’s going to live by the same standard .
they’re going to have the same standard as the poorest person in this room .
that’s the way it’s going to be .
it’s a good question .
but do you know if i answer that question , we’d have a big , big story .
you know that , right ?
you know , i’ll tell you , it is a question that’s asked a lot .
i know a lot of good people .
a couple of people on the stage that i really respect , i’ve gotten to respect .
but the truth is too early .
i like to get things done first .
we’ve got to close the deal .
i don’t want to think about it .
there are a lot of good people .
there are a lot of good people .
we’ve got to close the deal .
we’ve got to get it done .
and to get it done , i want iowa .
so good luck everybody .
thank you very much .
i love you .
i love you .
thank you .
and we’ll be back .
thank you .
so , we’re going to be discussing something so important for our country , for our economy , and for getting us all working again and working well again .
it’s a tax reform that i think will make america strong and great again .
too few americans are working .
too many jobs are being shipped overseas .
and too many middle income families can not make ends meet .
this plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business .
it will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other americans .
there will be a major tax reduction .
it will simplify the tax code .
it will grow the american economy at a level it hasn’t seen for decades .
and all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit .
but i will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals , we have to negotiate much harder , and we’ve got to make our economy strong .
changes for individuals will be at levels that you haven’t seen in a long time .
we’re going to cut the individual rates from 7 _UNK_ to _UNK_ _UNK_ .
25 % , 20 % , 10 % , and _UNK_ % .
if you’re single and earn less than $ _UNK_ per year or married and _UNK_ earn less than $ 50,000 – so , very important .
if you’re single and earn less than $ _UNK_ or married and _UNK_ earn less than $ 50,000 , you’ll not pay any income tax – nothing .
this _UNK_ very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty .
very unfair penalty .
it _UNK_ the _UNK_ , which is the alternative minimum tax .
it ends the death tax .
it’s a double _UNK_ .
a lot of families go through hell over the death tax .
it reduces or _UNK_ most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich – in other words , it’s going to cost me a fortune , which is actually true – while preserving _UNK_ giving and _UNK_ interest deductions .
very importantly .
it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest .
those are the hedge fund folks that i’ve been talking about for quite a while .
they make a lot of money .
carried interest .
so it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through _UNK_ partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital .
changes for business – now , so important , because it’s all about business .
it’s all about jobs .
we have _UNK_ million people in this country that are in serious trouble , that want to work ; they can’t work .
so for business , no business of any size from a fortune 500 company to a mom and _UNK_ shop to a _UNK_ living from _UNK_ to _UNK_ will pay more than 15 % of their business income in taxes .
big reduction .
a _UNK_ deemed _UNK_ of corporate cash held overseas at significantly _UNK_ which coming back at a significantly _UNK_ – 10 % .
so it comes back _UNK_ at a 10 % tax rate and ends the _UNK_ of taxes on corporate income earned abroad .
now , it’s called corporate _UNK_ .
it’s a huge subject .
i’ve been watching politicians now for years – all talk , no action politicians .
i’ve been watching them for years talking about bringing this money back .
the number is probably $ 2.5 trillion .
everybody agrees it should come back – republicans , democrats , everybody .
they can’t make a deal .
they don’t know how to go about making a deal .
the reason companies aren’t bringing it back is the tax is _UNK_ .
it doesn’t make sense to bring it back .
and in fact , many companies are leaving the united states .
they’re leaving our shores to go and collect their money .
they’re going actually moving out of the united states for two reasons – the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they can’t bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in .
it’s called leadership .
we will have that money brought back in .
as an example , i have millions of dollars overseas .
i can’t bring it back into this country .
we _UNK_ papers .
we’ve been doing this for a year and a half .
we can’t get it back in .
so the money stays in other countries and that’s what happens .
not good for us .
the level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important .
but this is something – and i’ve been watching it for a long time – everybody agrees to .
we also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes – many of them actually – and deductions made unnecessary or _UNK_ by the new lower tax rate on business income .
the tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated , which don’t make sense , and which are unfair are gone .
and we phase in a reasonable cap on the _UNK_ of the business interest expense .
so we are going to give you – we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex .
and we’re going to hand them out right now to the press .
and i think you’ll see we have an amazing code .
it will be simple .
it will be easy .
it will be fair .
it’s graduated .
as you get up in income , you pay a little more .
some of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer .
but i actually believe they’ll do better because i think the economy will grow .
it will grow rapidly .
and we’ll have something very special .
now , with all of that being said and before we take some questions , we have to cut the costs of what’s going on in this country .
if you look at what we’re doing and the money we’re spending .
i read where a _UNK_ – you know what a _UNK_ is ?
_UNK_ , _UNK_ , and _UNK_ – to send from one state to another , it was a 19 set _UNK_ and it cost $ _UNK_ and some _UNK_ dollars to send it from here to there .
and there are many examples .
_UNK_ that cost $ _UNK_ that you can buy in the store for a tiny amount of money .
we will run this country properly .
there is so much money to be saved .
we’re reducing taxes but at the same time if i win , if i become president , we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country .
we won’t be losing anything other than we’ll be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be .
so , this is a plan that’s simple , that’s a major reduction .
i think people are going to be very happy .
we’ve already had some very good reviews .
i did the plan with some of the leading scholars and economists and tax experts that there are in this country .
they love it ; they say `` why hasn’t this been done before ? ''
and this is my _UNK_ .
that’s what i do well .
the economy is what i do well .
whenever they do polls , i always come out way above everybody else on the economy and on leadership , by the way , but i won’t say that .
so , if anybody has – [ applause ] – thank you .
that’s amazing .
that’s some of the press was actually _UNK_ .
i’ve never saw – i don’t think i’ve ever seen that before .
all right .
why don’t we take some questions from the press ?
no , i’m not going to do that yet but we have their approval .
but we have some of the top people in the country worked on this .
well , we’re looking at a 3 % but we think it can be 5 % , it could even be 6 % .
we’re going to have growth that will be tremendous .
and by the way , if we have more than 3 % , these numbers are really _UNK_ .
and one of the things that they don’t take into account in any big league fashion is the cutting .
there is so much waste in government and i believe when i get in there i’ll be able to cut without losing anything to cut tremendous amounts off of the – and we’re not even showing anything for that .
so , they’re very conservative numbers .
my taxes will – first of all , i’ll have a much simpler tax statement .
it will be much simpler .
when i do my return , it will be much – my return go up to the ceiling and beyond , which is _UNK_ .
and you spend millions of dollars at a high level on lawyers , accountants , and everything else .
we want to simplify them to a tremendous level .
the _UNK_ of 25 % – the big difference is many of the loopholes and many of the deductions which are all – they’ve been there for years – are _UNK_ in many cases .
or are put there because a lot of the people that get these deductions are contributed to hillary , they’re contributing to bush .
they’re contributing to every candidate but trump .
because i’m not taking any money .
i’m _UNK_ .
and these people want these deductions .
there will be people – we’re reducing taxes .
but believe me , there will be people in the very upper _UNK_ that won’t be _UNK_ with this .
we’re taking away deductions and that’s one of the reasons we’re able to lower it .
this is actually a tax reduction .
a big tax reduction , including for the upper income .
i believe that the economy will do so well that even though they won’t be getting certain deductions which aren’t fair for them to be getting that they’ll end up doing better .
i just think this is a common sense approach .
you know , we could say supply side .
you could say there’s 15 different names given out for different kinds of deductions or increases .
i don’t think it’s supply side or anything else .
i think this is a common sense , well thought out tax proposal that’s going to trigger the economy , going to make everybody go back and really want to work .
it’s going to create tremendous numbers of jobs .
one of the other things that i’m _UNK_ this with is if i become president , i’m going to _UNK_ our trade deals .
because our trade deals are not sustainable by this country .
not sustainable .
we can not continue to let our jobs go to all of the different countries .
there’s not a country that we negotiate with that doesn’t make a better deal .
everybody .
we lose money with everything .
i’m also going to _UNK_ some of our military costs .
because we protect south korea , we protect germany , we protect some of the wealthiest countries in the world – saudi arabia – we protect everybody .
we protect everybody .
and we don’t get _UNK_ .
we lose on everything .
we lose on everything .
so , we’re going to negotiate and _UNK_ trade deals , military deals , many other deals that’s going to get the costs down for running our country very significantly .
i’m not showing a big number in that .
but i believe that if i become president , those numbers are going to be massive .
as an example , saudi arabia .
they make $ 1 billion a day .
we protect them .
so we need help .
we’re losing a tremendous amount of money on a _UNK_ basis and we owe $ 19 trillion .
i used to say $ 18 trillion for the last 6 , 7 months ; now it’s $ 19 trillion and it’s only going up .
well , no , look .
senator [ _UNK_ ] _UNK_ is a _UNK_ .
we understand that .
he wouldn’t be able to do this .
he wouldn’t know a trade deal from any other deal and what certain people are trying to do is they’re trying to take – we just went up in the last poll .
we went up two points in the last poll , and we continue to go up .
in the _UNK_ poll , i think we went from 26 % to 29 % .
we’re going up very strongly in the polls .
they don’t know what to do about it .
i’ve built a great company .
you’ll see that in 60 minutes last night .
i built a great company .
it’s a _UNK_ company with very little debt , tremendous cash flow .
i’m funding my own campaign .
guys like _UNK_ , i mean , he desperately needs money .
ask the car _UNK_ in florida .
ask the people that support him .
and a guy like _UNK_ and others – i don’t want to single him out ; you’re _UNK_ him out – but they’re largely controlled by their _UNK_ , the special interests , and frankly more than anybody else , the lobbyists .
i’ve turned down millions of millions of dollars from lobbyists and special interests because it’s not the right thing .
it’s just not right .
and that seems to be _UNK_ very strongly .
i negotiate .
it’s true .
i get bills from people ; i’ll negotiate .
oh , is that a bad thing ?
the country should do that .
yeah , i would .
i’d bring that same attitude to the white house .
it’s true .
she says i have a habit when you get a bill , you’d call up and you negotiate .
to me , that’s a _UNK_ .
no , i want to take that thinking to the white house .
i would bet you we could save 20 % of our budget .
i could even save more .
but we could save a tremendous amount .
that has to be the attitude our country has .
you can’t spend millions and millions of dollars on doing something that you can do for $ 2,000 .
you know , when you look at costs , we just spent $ 1 million building a _UNK_ field .
okay ?
a _UNK_ field for our prisoners that happen to be in guantanamo .
okay ?
i don’t like that .
what do you need $ 1 million for ?
level out the surface , let them play – if they had to play at all .
okay ?
what do you need to spend $ 1 million .
we just spent – it’s a story today .
$ 1 million on a _UNK_ field .
how do you spend $ 1 million doing a _UNK_ field ?
you have a level piece of land .
throw them a ball if they have to play _UNK_ – if they have to play at all .
why are they playing _UNK_ is my question .
no , it’s too long .
you don’t have time .
you don’t have time .
no , not at all .
we’re lowering taxes , which republicans love .
and i think one of the reasons i am doing so well in the polls and one of the reasons i’m doing so well when it comes to the economy in all polls is that this is the thinking .
no , we’re lowering taxes very substantially .
we’re _UNK_ .
and we’re getting rid of deductions that are actually _UNK_ that certain people want to keep for certain reasons .
so , no , that’s not true .
well , putin was _UNK_ and i was _UNK_ last night .
i thought his _UNK_ – i though charlie rose did an excellent job .
but i thought his was a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
scott _UNK_ _UNK_ me .
i thought scott was terrific .
i mean , it was a tough _UNK_ but i thought he was very fair and i thought the piece was very good .
why is he harder on me than putin ?
i would say because putin is a _UNK_ person than i am .
the worst in _UNK_ years .
well , it’s a good question and you can connect the _UNK_ .
but i guess it has been probably since _UNK_ .
you know , you’re talking about 10 , 11 , 12 years that people have wanted to bring the money back into the country .
and again it’s called corporate _UNK_ and in a lot of time corporations are moving out and they’re going to other countries , taking jobs .
and now , we have a really big problem because we have serious companies – very large , very _UNK_ companies as you know – obviously you know something about business .
but we have major companies looking to move out of the united states .
you know , it used to be they’d move from new york to florida .
they’d move from new jersey to texas .
or whatever .
now , they’re talking about moving from the united states to ireland and to _UNK_ and to other places , to _UNK_ where they get treated differently and frankly better .
and they’re doing that for a number of reasons but one of the reasons – one of the big reasons – as you know is taxes .
one of the other reasons is to get all of this cash that they’ve built up and they can’t get back into our country .
and when this money comes back into our country that everybody wants , it’s going to be put to work in our country , largely .
it can go other places .
but largely .
and i think it will be an amazing _UNK_ .
now , here’s the other thing .
they think it’s $ 2.5 trillion .
i think it’s much more than that .
i actually think it’s going to be more money than that .
and boy if it is , we have hit pay _UNK_ .
well , you know when you end the _UNK_ , when you get the money coming back in beyond , tremendous things happen .
well , i’ll be announcing that in the not too distant future .
but i will tell you .
i’ve been honest .
i’m the only one that’s honest about this thing .
i watched romney .
i watched all – `` oh , i pay so much tax .
i pay so much tax . ''
i watched all politicians and they say `` i pay – `` i fight like hell to pay as little as possible .
can i say that ?
i’m not a politician .
i fight like hell always because it’s an expense .
and you know , i feel – i fight .
i have the best lawyers and the best accountants and i fight .
and i pay .
but it’s an expense .
and frankly , i would feel differently if this country was spending the money wisely instead of throwing it out the _UNK_ .
our country spends our money so _UNK_ and i will tell you that i could speak for myself i pay a lot of tax but i fight like hell to make it as low as possible .
but i would feel a lot differently if our leadership was such that i respected the decisions .
all you have to do is look at a list of the things that our government is spending money on right now and you don’t feel so good about our country .
i’ll tell you what in terms of income inequality , we’re going to create a lot of jobs .
you know , right now , we have a false – _UNK_ % , _UNK_ % , _UNK_ % – every month it’s different .
it’s such a _UNK_ number .
because when people look and look and look and then they give up looking for a job , they’re taken off the roll .
so the number isn’t _UNK_ .
i’ve seen numbers of 24 % .
i actually saw a number of _UNK_ % unemployment .
_UNK_ % .
and it could be because when you’re looking for a job and you go around and you look and you look and you find it , you want to work and you want to take care of your family and then you can’t get the job – you know what i’m talking about because you’re _UNK_ your head – and you can’t get the job , essentially for _UNK_ purposes you are considered _UNK_ .
so then i read every time it comes out i hear _UNK_ % unemployment .
that is the biggest joke there is in this country .
that number is so false .
and you know , people ask `` how come trump is doing so well ?
and _UNK_ and others ?
how come they’re doing - ? ''
you know why they’re doing well ?
because people are tired of political speak .
they’re tired of that .
and the worst example of it – one of the worst example of it – is the _UNK_ unemployment rate .
the unemployment rate is probably 20 % .
but i will tell you you have some great economists that will tell you it’s 30 % , _UNK_ % .
and the highest i’ve heard so far is _UNK_ % .
there’s anger out there at the job picture .
now , one of the things – with that being said , china , japan , mexico , brazil , these countries are all taking our jobs like we’re a bunch of _UNK_ .
that will stop .
people will treat us fairly if i become president .
we’re losing our jobs .
we’re losing our base .
we’re losing our manufacturing .
all of that will stop .
well , this is number one a _UNK_ .
number two , what i’m really doing is the big picture because corporations now are going to start having an incentive to create jobs .
they’re going to have an incentive also to stay in this country .
_UNK_ , if they provide bigger _UNK_ , people are going to have more money to spend .
so that’s not so bad either .
if a corporation gives out a bigger _UNK_ , that’s great .
mr. jones gets a bigger _UNK_ , he’s going to have more money to spend in the economy .
so that’s good .
i know nothing about that .
no , i’m not a _UNK_ .
no , i’m not .
i’m a man of great common sense .
i’m a man that’s built a tremendous company with the best _UNK_ in real _UNK_ , the best everything .
you’re here at one of them .
i have many of these .
i’ve done a great job .
i’ve _UNK_ tens of thousands of people .
i employ now thousands and thousands of people .
i’ve done a good job .
but i wouldn’t say _UNK_ at all .
i would say i’m a man of common sense .
i’m cutting taxes .
i’m going to create a lot of jobs .
i’m going to get rid of a tremendous amount of waste .
and i’ll tell you what .
the waste that i get rid of – the waste that i get rid of – is going to have a huge impact and i’m not even putting that in my numbers so i think it’s going to be terrific .
yes , the _UNK_ industry .
that’s a beautiful way of describing it – the _UNK_ industry .
where are you from ?
_UNK_ ?
i love them .
oh , what a beautiful _UNK_ .
no , i want to get the industry – we call it the _UNK_ industry .
but i want to get the _UNK_ industry to build factories here .
as you know , ford is building $ 2.5 billion factory in mexico .
mexico also took a big plant out of tennessee and tennessee thought they were going to get it and they didn’t .
i want the _UNK_ companies , as you would say , or the _UNK_ companies to build their plants in the united states .
i don’t want _UNK_ leaving for mexico or any place else .
i want these companies not to leave chicago , not to leave michigan , not to leave new hampshire and iowa and south carolina and all of these places where they’re leaving and they’re going to other countries .
i want them to stay here and they will stay here and they’ll be so happy .
ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much .
it’s been a great honor .
thank you .
_UNK_ has become an epidemic .
25 years ago , 35 years ago , you look at the statistics .
not even close .
it has gotten _UNK_ out of control .
i am _UNK_ in favor of _UNK_ but i want smaller _UNK_ over a longer period of time .
because you take a baby in – and i’ve seen it and i’ve seen it and i had my children taken care of over a long period of time , over a two or three year period of time , same _UNK_ amount .
but you take this little beautiful baby and you pump – i mean , it looks just like it’s meant for a horse not for a child .
and we’ve had so many instances – people that work for me just the other day – two years old , two and a half years old , a child – a beautiful child – went to have the _UNK_ and came back and a week later got a tremendous _UNK_ , got very , very sick , now is _UNK_ .
i only say – i’m in favor of _UNK_ .
do them over a longer period of time .
same amount but just in little _UNK_ .
and i think you’re going to have – i think you’re going to see a big impact on _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , oh , boy .
i didn’t expect that .
you know , joe [ _UNK_ ] and the group [ veterans for a strong america ] called and they said `` would you come over and speak ? ''
i’m here for a certain reason .
you know , it’s called tomorrow night .
so i got here and they asked a couple of days ago if it would possible to come over and say a few words .
an _UNK_ from your group with so many veterans – hundreds of thousands of veterans – i really appreciate that , joe .
i did not expect that .
i didn’t expect it .
i didn’t ask for it .
i will say this : i am with the veterans 100 % .
they’re our greatest people .
they’re being treated _UNK_ .
not only the number of deaths , which are obviously – that’s what’s going on is incredible .
but as of two weeks ago on wednesday , the vets had the longest wait in the history of the veterans administration .
you go in to see a doctor , you wait for days , for days .
and it’s not going to happen .
not going to happen .
if i win , believe me , it’s not going to happen .
and one of the things i thought i’d do and i’d stress so strongly – the veterans hospitals – obviously they have problems .
they’re not properly run .
and when you have to wait long hours and long days and then in some cases have the doctor say `` i’m sorry .
i’m going on vacation '' , believe me , it doesn’t get much worse than that .
so we’re going to create a whole new system .
we’re going to take this system apart .
and if they’re not doing the job , the veterans are going to go to private doctors , private hospitals , public hospitals , and we’re going to _UNK_ those doctors and those hospitals .
and you’re going to get the greatest service of any veterans in any country because you deserve it .
and that’s going to be broken down into something that’s going to be very special .
right now – and you know it – we have illegal immigrants that are treated better by far than our veterans .
it’s not going to happen anymore .
it’s not going to happen .
so , joe , i just really appreciate it .
so unexpected .
to be here is an honor .
they don’t build ships like this anymore , folks .
you know ?
we don’t do them this way anymore .
i actually said what about _UNK_ – look at this thing .
the largest guns in the world .
the most powerful guns .
i learned about the iowa .
by the way , iowa is a great place for a lot of reasons .
you know ?
we have been treated so well in the state of iowa .
it’s been incredible .
number one on the polls and we love those people .
they’re great .
so this is a great ship and that’s a great state .
i just want to say that we’re going to come out with some plans in a very short time .
we’re going to be building up our military .
we’re going to make our military so big and so strong and so great .
and it will be so powerful that i don’t think we’re going to ever have to use it .
_UNK_ going to mess with us .
that i can tell you .
and we’re going to have a president who’s respected by putin , who’s respected by iran .
you know , let’s talk about for two _UNK_ , let’s talk about the iran deal .
now , obama and his people call him the supreme leader of iran .
obama talks about the supreme leader .
well , i’m not calling him a supreme leader .
but he said the other day that after this _UNK_ deal is completed , he will never touch , do business with the united states again .
`` we’re finished with the united states . ''
they’re taking $ 150 billion .
they’re getting a deal that’s going to go right into nuclear weapons much sooner than you think .
they’re going to _UNK_ – think about that one – they are going to go and _UNK_ .
they’ve got the _UNK_ – they have _UNK_ provisions .
and by the way , what people don’t understand – the _UNK_ provision doesn’t start – you know this , right ?
it doesn’t start for a long time before you even get to it .
the clock is _UNK_ .
it can take forever .
we may never get it there .
it is one of the _UNK_ deals and one of the _UNK_ contracts i’ve ever seen of any kind .
so , we are going to do things and this country right .
we’re not going to sign deals where we have four prisoners over there and there’s still there and we don’t even ask for them .
one of them is there because he’s a christian .
we have a _UNK_ .
we have – the whole thing is absolutely _UNK_ .
you know , they asked the president , and they asked secretary of state kerry who maybe – you know , i’ve been saying hillary clinton is the worst secretary of state in the history of this country .
right ?
all right .
i’ve been saying it .
but it’s possible – the world _UNK_ up around her .
it _UNK_ up .
just _UNK_ up .
the whole world is like a different place .
it’s possible that because of this deal made by secretary kerry who has absolutely no _UNK_ how to negotiate , it may that he’s going to _UNK_ .
and i understand that he may want to run for president .
he has no chance like she has no chance .
so we’re going to see what happens .
we have many problems in our country .
one of them is immigration .
now , i took a tremendous hit when i brought up illegal immigration when i announced i was running for president .
and for two weeks , i said – you know , rush _UNK_ – he’s a great guy – he said `` he has suffered more incoming '' – meaning the press – `` than anybody i’ve seen . ''
so what happened is you have now found out what illegal immigration is all about and i am so happy that i’m the one that brought it to the _UNK_ because believe me , it’s a big problem .
it is a big problem .
so you remember for about two weeks , i said , `` boy this is tougher than i thought running for president . ''
and then you found out there’s tremendous crime .
there’s tremendous drugs _UNK_ across the border .
tremendous .
beyond .
going to chicago , going to new york , going to la , going all over our country .
so the drugs _UNK_ in and the money _UNK_ out .
not a good deal .
we get the drugs , they get the money .
the drug cartels are going wild .
they can not believe how _UNK_ our government is .
they are making a fortune .
the drugs come in .
the money goes out daily .
and i saw it because i was on the border .
i was there .
and we saw it .
and everybody sees it everyday .
and we have the kind of people that can do something about it but we have no leadership .
none .
none whatsoever .
so , we’re going to build a wall and mexico’s going to pay for the wall , believe me .
you know , a lot of politicians have said `` oh , they’re not going to pay '' .
they don’t know anything about – they never read the _UNK_ of the deal , first of all .
so here’s the story .
so here’s the story .
i said the other day to one of my people `` what is the united _UNK_ trade deficit with mexico , japan , and china ? ''
so let’s start with china .
almost $ 400 billion a year .
now , if you have a company where you’re losing $ 400 billion , you’ve got to do something very fast .
we don’t .
we’ve been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year frankly for decades .
not going to happen anymore .
not going to happen anymore .
with japan where their massive ships _UNK_ right here and they drop off the cars , right ?
they drop off thousands and thousands and thousands of cars – millions of cars – and we sell them _UNK_ .
we sell them _UNK_ .
and they don’t want it because their farmers don’t want our _UNK_ .
they protest and they send it back .
all right ?
it’s not going to happen that way anymore .
now , with mexico – and i love mexico .
i have many , many people – many , many people from mexico that work with me and they work for me and they buy my _UNK_ .
same with china .
i have so many people .
they pay me millions and millions .
what am i supposed to hate china because they gave me millions of dollars to buy an apartment ?
i don’t think so .
i had the largest bank in the world as a _UNK_ .
it’s from china .
bigger than any bank in this country by many times .
they’re from china .
the problem that we have is that the leaders of mexico , japan , and china and every other country that we do business with , they’re smarter , more _UNK_ , _UNK_ than our leaders .
i love free trade .
the concept is great .
but you need smart people .
i have the _UNK_ people in this country lined up .
i know the _UNK_ .
i have carl _UNK_ .
i have the best business leaders and they all want to do it .
they’re wealthy because they make good deals like me .
i make good deals .
you know , it’s a talent .
it’s a talent .
you can’t be a politician .
look , i’m fighting some very nice people .
very nice .
even though i’m leading in the polls .
but they’re very nice people .
but they’re never going to do anything with these countries .
they’re never going to be able to do it .
it’s an instinct .
it’s something that’s special .
they don’t have it .
believe me , they don’t have it .
it’s just going to be more of the same .
so , we are going to make our country so great .
we are going to make it strong .
we are going to make it powerful .
we’re going to rebuild the military .
we’re going to make it so strong .
we are going to take care of our veterans .
and in the end , in the end , i want you people to look around and look at each other because this is going to be a special day .
the other week – two weeks ago in mobile , alabama , _UNK_ people showed up in a _UNK_ rough day .
_UNK_ people came to see us speak and we’re talking about making america great again .
last night in dallas at the american airlines center , 20,000 people – the basketball _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
20,000 people showed up and i want to tell you , it was a love _UNK_ .
everybody – think of it , 20,000 people – there wasn’t one _UNK_ in the whole room .
i kept saying , `` there’s got to be one . ''
there was a word – two words that used to be used a lot called `` silent majority '' .
they stopped using them .
the silent majority , believe me , is back and i think we can use it _UNK_ different .
i don’t think we have to call it a silent majority anymore because they’re not silent .
people are not silent .
they’re _UNK_ with our _UNK_ politicians .
they’re _UNK_ with the people that are giving our country away .
they’re _UNK_ when they tell the border patrol agents who are good people and can do the job .
they’re _UNK_ when they’re allowed people to just walk right in front of them and they’re standing there _UNK_ and people just _UNK_ into the country .
they’re _UNK_ when a woman who’s nine months _UNK_ , walks across the border , has a baby , and you have to take care of that baby for the next 85 years .
they’re _UNK_ by what’s happening to our country .
and you’re going to look around and you’re going to remember who the people are that are here because we’re doing something special .
this is a movement .
we’re going to make our country great again .
believe me , we will make our country great again .
i love you all .
thank you very much .
thank you very much , everybody .
thank you all for being here .
this is some _UNK_ .
my great honor .
the chairman just left as you probably know and he’s been extremely fair .
the _UNK_ has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period .
and as you know , that’s what i’ve wanted .
i wanted fairness .
i don’t have to be treated any differently than anybody else .
i just wanted fairness from the republican party .
we’re leading in every single poll .
a new poll came out today where we’re over 30 % .
we’ve actually hit numbers as high as 35 % and 40 % .
and frankly , i’ve felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the democrats and very easily i think beat the democrats no matter who it may be whether it’s hillary or anybody else and i think maybe hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what’s happening getting to the starting gate , the best way for the republicans to win is if i win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up .
and for that reason , i have signed the pledge .
so i will be _UNK_ _UNK_ my allegiance to the republican party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win .
we will win .
and most importantly , we will make our country great again because that’s what it’s all about .
we have to make our country great again .
this is a _UNK_ campaign .
we have our heart in it .
we have our soul in it .
i don’t need money and i don’t want money .
and this is going to be a campaign like i think no other .
i’m not controlled by lobbyists .
i’m not controlled by anybody .
i’m controlled by the people of the country in order to make our country great again .
yeah , i got nothing .
i really got nothing .
the question was what did i get for signing the pledge ?
absolutely nothing .
other than the _UNK_ that i would be treated fairly .
and i’ve seen that over the last two months .
they really have been very fair .
no , i have no intention of changing my mind .
well , i think the big thing that’s changed is – and it’s been obvious to all – number one , after i announced , we went up like a rocket ship .
nobody thought i was going to run and they said `` oh , he won’t run and he won’t put in his papers .
and he wouldn’t do all of this . ''
i did that .
the papers in terms of the company turned out to be _UNK_ .
it’s a great company .
i built a great company .
and all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received .
and i think the thing that’s changed is the fact that i went to number one place very quickly after i signed and after i in this building _UNK_ everybody that i’d be running for president .
so i think the biggest thing is that i went early to number one and the _UNK_ has treated me with great respect .
so that was very important .
no , i see no circumstances under which i would tear up that pledge .
well , you don’t have to be met when you’re at 2 % .
it’s one of those things .
that’s the way life works .
and i like _UNK_ .
[ chris ] _UNK_ , by the way .
well , the chairman asked if he could come up .
you saw him .
he was here a little while ago .
and i was greatly honored that he did come up frankly .
well , i think that when you get right down to it , we’re a nation that speaks english and i think that while we’re in this nation , we should be speaking english .
and that’s how _UNK_ takes .
and that’s how – i mean , whether people like it or not that’s how we _UNK_ and that’s how we go on to that next phase and that next stage .
and that’s how people that don’t speak – and i’m not just talking about _UNK_ ; i’m talking about from various parts of the world – that’s how they will become successful and do great .
so i think it’s more appropriate to be speaking english .
well , one of the things i want to do and i feel very strongly it’s a country based on borders and our country is based on laws .
and when people come into the country illegally , we should not allow that .
and this is not from south america .
this is not from mexico .
this is from all over the world .
when people come illegally , we can not allow that .
and i want people to come legally .
i want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess .
that’s been proven .
and _UNK_ , a couple of months ago when i announced , i made some very strong statements about the crime and the problems that were happening and i’ve been proven right .
and many of the people in this audience actually have _UNK_ to me , which i very much appreciate .
of course , they haven’t done it publicly but these are minor details but someday they will .
the fact is that we are a nation that wants and needs borders .
we’re a nation that wants and needs and is based on laws .
and we will make sure that that takes place .
with that being said , i want people to come into our country legally .
i want to have a big , _UNK_ beautiful open door .
i want people of great talent to come in for _UNK_ valley .
i want engineers .
i want _UNK_ .
i want people with great talent to come into the united states .
when people graduate from college , you can be number one in your class at harvard or number one at _UNK_ or the _UNK_ school of finance or _UNK_ or stanford .
and immediately if you’re not a citizen of the united states , you get thrown out of the country .
we want those people to stay .
we want people of great talent to be in the united states to work here and ultimately to become a citizen .
i don’t know enough about it to comment on it .
was she jailed ?
i really don’t know much about it .
that’s absolutely false .
i win at _UNK_ .
i win at _UNK_ .
that i can tell you .
well , i understand how the system works maybe better than anybody .
i understand the political system and i understand also very much a system for coming in for illegal immigrants .
don’t forget if i didn’t bring up the subject of illegal immigration , you wouldn’t be asking the question .
nobody would be even talking about immigration .
and immigration and in particular illegal immigration has become a very big factor .
now , a lot of bad things have happened with respect to crime since i brought it up .
but if i didn’t bring it up , immigration would not even be a subject that we’re talking about and it happens to be a very important subject .
i have to say this : it can also be a very positive subject because i believe so strongly in immigration and i just – we have to stop illegal immigration and we have to look forward to great immigration done in a legal manner .
but if i didn’t bring it up , nobody would be talking about it .
well , there is gridlock in congress right now and that’s because there’s no leadership at the top .
you have to be able to lead .
you have to be able to get people into your office .
you have to get people go to them .
any way you want to do it .
but you have to be able to lead .
there is no leadership at the top .
signing executive orders it not the way our country was supposed to be run .
i don’t want to talk about that .
it’s _UNK_ .
tom _UNK_ ?
well , tom _UNK_ is a very good friend of mine .
he’s a great guy .
for those of you who don’t know him , he’s a very _UNK_ and an honest guy and a truly great _UNK_ .
he is really a very good friend of mine .
and i just spoke to him a little while ago .
he’s so _UNK_ and so happy .
tom _UNK_ – i think what they’ve done is terrible .
and he’s been _UNK_ as i understand it because i just heard about it .
but i’m very happy for tom .
as far as the _UNK_ is concerned , they’re having a rough year .
let’s face it .
they’re having a very rough year .
well , in europe they have tremendous problems with people going in and _UNK_ .
and it’s a huge humanitarian problem .
and i just say this .
this united states has tremendous problems of their own .
we have infrastructure that we have to fix .
we have bridges and roads and _UNK_ and everything is falling apart .
our nation’s in such trouble .
that’s why being a _UNK_ and a great _UNK_ and a very successful _UNK_ i think will greatly help .
but we have so many of our own problems including the border , including the wall , which we will get built , including all of the things we have – health care , which is a mess .
you know , if you look at obamacare , the premiums have gone up 45 % , 50 % , 55 % .
people are saying `` this is turning out to be a disaster . ''
_UNK_ are through the roof .
the _UNK_ on obamacare it’s through the roof .
so we have a lot of problems .
we have to take care of our vets .
we have to build up our military .
just the other day , _UNK_ [ ray ] _UNK_ said that the army is in the worst shape in its history in terms of _UNK_ .
now , for them to be in bad shape with the way we are and with the world _UNK_ us , and you look at hillary clinton – and i’ve said she’s the worst secretary of state in the history of this country .
now , in all fairness , because of the agreement that’s about to be finalized with iran , john kerry may very well take her place .
i think that agreement is a disaster for this country , for israel , for the middle east .
it’s going to lead to nuclear proliferation – the _UNK_ clause – everything about it .
we don’t even get our prisoners back .
you say who _UNK_ a thing like that ?
that won’t happen , i can guarantee you , with a president trump .
you’ll see it later .
yeah .
they don’t want to hear it .
_UNK_ would say very simply i just want to be treated like everybody else .
you see , i was always the fair hair boy .
i was a big _UNK_ .
nobody knows the system .
but i was on the other side .
and i was the _UNK_ .
i was the fair hair person .
once i ran , all of a sudden i was a little bit of an _UNK_ .
i became an _UNK_ because i was running .
because i wasn’t supposed to run .
i’m this _UNK_ that people have given me great credit as being a great _UNK_ .
but i’m not supposed to be running for office .
the fact is that our country is being killed on trade by china , by japan , by mexico both at the border and on trade .
and i’m not _UNK_ those countries .
their leaders are much , much smarter than our leaders .
they are absolutely killing us .
china – taking our jobs , taking our money , taking our base .
and think of this : we owe china $ _UNK_ trillion and we’re paying them interest .
we owe japan with all of the cars coming in the same amount – $ _UNK_ trillion .
now , that’s like a magic act .
they send the cars in , they take our jobs , they do everything , and we owe them money .
that’s not going to happen with me .
_UNK_ , _UNK_ bush is a very nice man .
i’ll be honest .
i think he’s a very nice person .
i think he’s a very low energy person and i don’t think that’s what the country needs .
i hear he’s going to spend a lot of money on negative ads on me .
and honestly , look , he’s getting the money from special interests .
he’s getting the money from lobbyists and his _UNK_ .
and they’re making him do it because he’s _UNK_ in the polls .
so i don’t know what’s going to happen if he spends $ 20 million or $ 25 million on negative ads – i don’t know .
i know that my life will continue .
i just don’t know .
i mean _UNK_ ever spent money on ads against me .
but he probably has to do that although it would not be the way i’ve done .
you know , one of the things i’m most honored about is that so far everybody that’s attacked me has gone down the _UNK_ .
you have _UNK_ _UNK_ attacked me .
he was at 3 % .
now he’s at zero .
you have _UNK_ attacked me .
now he’s getting out of the race .
he was at 4 % or 5 % .
now he’s getting out of the race .
he was at zero .
everybody – _UNK_ paul attacked me .
i see the last poll – the _UNK_ poll that just came out today where i’m leading by double figures and _UNK_ paul is down to less than 2 % and he attacked me .
now , _UNK_ bush also just went down in the _UNK_ poll very big .
so i don’t know .
are they going to spend – he’s going to spend _UNK_ money and special interest money .
remember this – they have total control over _UNK_ and hillary and everybody else that takes that money .
nobody knows the system better than me .
they have total control .
you understand it very well because you’ve been covering it for a long time .
those people that are putting up those millions of dollars have total control over your candidate .
i will tell you this : _UNK_ putting up millions of dollars for me .
i’m putting up my own money .
in fact , i feel a little bit _UNK_ .
people are offering me millions and millions of dollars .
you know , when you’re in first place , you can collect so much money and i keep turning them down .
i feel like – am i a _UNK_ ?
i feel very _UNK_ .
and when i was in iowa last week , i said `` what do you think ?
can i take – `` one man offered me – a big _UNK_ – offered $ 5 million for my campaign .
i said to the crowd in iowa – great crowd , _UNK_ people – i said `` can i take it ?
and would you believe i’m not going to do anything ?
i promise you .
i _UNK_ to you i won’t do anything . ''
and they all stood up and said `` no , no , don’t take it . ''
the fact is i’m the only _UNK_ .
i’m putting up my own money .
i know there have been some _UNK_ _UNK_ – 5 or 6 _UNK_ _UNK_ – where people are _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ for trump .
i have nothing to do with them .
as you know , you’re not allowed to have anything to do with them .
so i don’t know what they’re going to do .
hopefully , if they’re going to do something it’s going to be nice .
but i don’t know anything about them .
but just in a _UNK_ , i’m funding my own campaign .
nobody else’s .
when people _UNK_ – and i hope the voters can see this .
every negative ad they see about me is paid for by lobbyists and special interests .
so just remember that .
our country could be doing much better .
we have deficits that are enormous .
we have all bad trade agreements .
we have an army that the heads said is not prepared .
we have a military that needs help and especially in these times .
we have nuclear weapons that you look at 60 minutes they don’t even work .
okay ?
if anybody saw that report .
the phones don’t work .
they’re 40 years old .
they have _UNK_ that are no good .
nothing works .
our country doesn’t work .
everybody _UNK_ except us .
we need victories in this country .
we don’t have victories any more .
our country will be great again , but right now our country has major problems .
i think it’s great that she’s [ _UNK_ _UNK_ ] in the debate .
i was in favor of her being – i think she should be in the debate .
i don’t like the fact that there are 11 people now as i understand it .
they’re not getting rid of _UNK_ paul or somebody .
but i think they should because there’s too many people .
because when you have 11 , you’re not getting to hear me and you’re not getting to hear other people talking and i think that’s too bad .
i think 11 is a lot of people .
but i was very happy that she got into the debate because frankly she deserves to be in the debate .
i think maybe he’s [ joe biden ] _UNK_ not to get in the race .
i think it’s going to depend on what happens with hillary clinton .
a lot of people think that she will not be able to make it legally from a criminal _UNK_ to the starting gate .
i don’t know that to be true .
but i think it depends on what happens with her .
i think if she gets out , he will get in .
i think if she stays in , he might not .
who knows ?
oh , he’s not supposed to be here because he was here , he was up in my office and he got the pledge and we’re very happy about that .
we don’t want anything – and i told him .
i said , `` i don’t know if it’s appropriate _UNK_ for you to be here because i don’t want anything – `` you know , you guys will end up saying he’s _UNK_ trump .
so i suggested frankly that i’m fine with him not being here because i don’t want anybody to think he’s _UNK_ .
as far as _UNK_ is concerned , i watched him this morning on television and it’s a little bit _UNK_ .
don’t forget .
he was supposed to win .
and he just doesn’t have the energy .
but what he does have is a lot of money that was given to him again by special interests , _UNK_ , and lobbyists .
and i just hope that if he spends money on ads , which he may not – if i were him , i’d spend money on positive ads about himself .
because if he _UNK_ me , assuming people leave and maybe they’re at a point where they’re not going to leave because they’re fed up with what’s happening in this country , but i think they’re going to go to people other than _UNK_ .
i don’t know .
right now , i’m interested in jobs .
one thing – one of the groups , it was actually cnn .
i shouldn’t say that .
but they did a very massive poll and i came out number one in leadership , number one on the economy , number one in jobs producing .
and i don’t mean by number one .
i mean like number one by many , many times .
and i am so intent on putting people back to work in this country .
you know , we have _UNK_ million people that are not in the workforce right now .
_UNK_ million .
when they give up looking for a job , they take them off of the _UNK_ .
they take them off the statistics .
we have _UNK_ million people .
we have 50 million people between poverty levels and welfare and all .
our country can be great again .
we have to put people back to work .
would i bring my children into the administration ?
i will tell you they are very capable .
the answer is probably not .
but having them in would be very good .
they’re very , very capable children .
the second part i won’t _UNK_ asking you .
it’s no longer _UNK_ .
_UNK_ west ?
you know what ?
i’ll never say bad about him .
you know why ?
because he loves trump .
he loves trump .
he goes around saying `` trump is my _UNK_ hero . ''
he says it to everybody .
so , _UNK_ west – i love him .
now , maybe in a few years i’ll have to run against him .
i don’t know .
so i’ll take that back .
but he’s been so nice to me .
you people have sort of seen because i’ve been a _UNK_ .
i only hit people when they hit me .
only .
and _UNK_ west has been so great .
i would never say bad about him because he says such nice things about me .
no , my supporters are really supporting me because i’m very _UNK_ , because they know that i’m not going to let china _UNK_ us off .
i’m not going to let japan _UNK_ us off .
japan is _UNK_ their _UNK_ .
very hard for _UNK_ and other companies to compete against _UNK_ – their big _UNK_ _UNK_ – and others .
we’re not going to let this happen anymore .
they do – you talk about a trade _UNK_ .
they have in japan the biggest ships you’ve ever seen _UNK_ cars into los _UNK_ , _UNK_ them in .
i’ve never seen anything like it .
we send them _UNK_ and they don’t even want it .
it’s going to end and they’re going to like us .
in this building , i have the largest bank in the world .
right up these _UNK_ .
it’s a bank from china .
by far the biggest bank in the world .
i get along great with china .
i get along great with japan .
i get along great with mexico .
i love the people .
i love the people of mexico .
i love the _UNK_ .
i have thousands of _UNK_ right now working for me .
over the years , i have _UNK_ tens of thousands of _UNK_ – many from mexico .
i have _UNK_ great relationships .
and in the package that we gave you , you’ll see there’s a poll and i’m number one with _UNK_ .
you saw that .
number one with _UNK_ .
so , look , for our country to be great , we have to be able to make great deals .
we’re going to be great to the vets .
we’re going to be terrific .
our military is going to be _UNK_ .
all of these things – we’re going to get rid of obamacare and come up with something that’s much better and much less expensive .
we’re going to get rid of it .
we’re going to repeal it .
it’s going to be out .
should have been out a long time ago .
should have never happened .
but we are going to take care of our country and we are going to bring back jobs and we’re going to bring back wealth to the united states so we can afford to save social security , which i’ll save without cuts , so that we can afford to do the kind of things that we have to do to make america great again .
ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much .
and here is your pledge .
_UNK_ going to tell you a story about _UNK_ .
you’re not even going to believe it .
but it’s a very personal story .
it’s a very special place to me for a very special reason .
but maybe more importantly , we have an incredible woman with us .
she’s _UNK_ years old .
we don’t talk about age but she’s _UNK_ and she looks magnificent .
and her name is _UNK_ and she’s become very famous .
you know who _UNK_ is , right ?
_UNK_ , where are you _UNK_ ?
look at her .
so beautiful .
so , she just registered to vote for the first time in her life .
she hasn’t seen anybody that really did it to her .
and for the first time in her life she just registered to vote and she’s going to vote for trump .
i think , right ?
thank you , _UNK_ .
i really appreciate it .
you know , she’s become so famous .
she’s on television all over the world now .
i have to be nervous even talking to her , you’re so famous .
it’s great .
_UNK_ , thank you very much .
i really appreciate it and everybody _UNK_ it .
because there is a big , big growing like _UNK_ and _UNK_ silent majority out there and we’re going to take this country back and we’re going to make this country so great again and so strong again .
_UNK_ , i just want to tell you about _UNK_ .
so , years ago – many years ago – like i hate to say 40 but i won’t say 40 but close to 40 , i came to _UNK_ .
did you ever hear of a company called _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ .
right ?
so , they were based in _UNK_ , tennessee , and they owned the _UNK_ _UNK_ department store chain .
and i was a young guy and i came from _UNK_ in _UNK_ , and i wanted to go into manhattan .
and i went into manhattan and i did the grand _UNK_ _UNK_ and i did some other things that were good .
but the thing i wanted more than anything was fifth avenue between _UNK_ and _UNK_ street , which is called the _UNK_ _UNK_ right next to _UNK_ .
and that’s what i wanted .
i wanted that piece of property so badly .
i shouldn’t say that because you’re not supposed to want things like that so badly .
god will get angry at me , right ?
but i wanted it so badly and the company that owned it was _UNK_ based in _UNK_ , tennessee .
and i came in and i came to _UNK_ , and i met with the heads of _UNK_ who were really great people actually .
and they were having a lot of difficulties .
there were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything .
and i convinced them to sell me the land and the building .
and i bought the _UNK_ _UNK_ store fifth avenue from _UNK_ to _UNK_ street surrounding _UNK_ .
i bought all the air rights and then ultimately i bought the air rights from _UNK_ and i built trump tower .
and to this day it’s one of the great buildings of the world and it’s one of the great successes .
and i love country music and i went to the grand _UNK_ _UNK_ while i was here .
and i just had such an incredible experience .
and when it came down to speaking because we could speak at a lot of places – you know , when you’re leading in every poll , they sort of want you .
when you’re not leading in the polls , like so many of these guys , they don’t want you at all .
and we’ll talk about the polls in a second .
but i had a lot of choices for this morning , and i guess i could have also gone and played _UNK_ like the president does all the time , right ?
but i decided let’s do this .
and i really chose _UNK_ because the experience is one of my – it’s not my biggest deal but in terms of a deal it’s so important and it’s been such a great – from the day i built it it was a home run .
and it all really took place because of _UNK_ , tennessee .
so , i really – it’s an honor to be with you folks , i can tell you .
real honor .
so , coming over i heard and i watched television – you know , they have all these cameras back there and they’re live .
and i guess we’re live on cnn , we’re live on so many different things .
it’s always difficult .
you know , when you’re always live , you’ve got to change up your speech .
you can’t make the speech over and _UNK_ the other candidates don’t get covered live ever , except for the debate .
so you know , they had 24 million people on the debate .
now they think when the new numbers come out they’ll be even substantially higher than that .
so i _UNK_ said they would have had a million or two .
so i say they have 24 million people .
and i say , well now the second debate , which is on cnn – that was on fox , maybe i should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity .
does that make sense ?
all to charity .
all to charity .
when i said that to the writers at time magazine , they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story .
and i said , you know , and i sort of thought i said it off the record but they put it in time magazine .
so now – maybe should i ask for charity , maybe a nice _UNK_ charity and american cancer society and aids research – so many of this – there’s so many good – _UNK_ – you know , there’s so many things going on .
maybe i should ask for a lot of money or i’m not showing up .
you know , it’s interesting .
so they’ll get 2 million – a million to 2 million people at the debates .
you know , they’ve been doing them for a long time .
they don’t do great , especially the early republican debate .
like you know the expression – it draws flies ?
that’s what it draws .
so this was one of the biggest shows in the history of cable television .
i think it might have been the biggest in terms of political in the history of cable television .
naturally i took full credit for it , which in all fairness i should .
i should .
so bottom line i think i might ask for a lot of money for charity but you know .
but i did say is it a little _UNK_ if i do that ?
maybe it’s not so nice .
so what do you think ?
should i do it or not ?
maybe not .
i don’t know .
here’s the thing .
if i don’t do it , cnn just makes a lot of money .
i don’t care about cnn .
honestly .
no , they’re going to make a lot of money .
they just shut off their _UNK_ .
they’re actually very nice .
but they’re going to make a lot of money and , you know , it’s something we should consider .
so we’ll all consider it together .
but coming over today , i saw that they were having the illegal immigrants come in and somebody mentioned the term the dreamers having to do with children and , you know , the dreams of children .
and these are people who come over to the country and they’re dreamers .
and i said , `` what about our children ? ''
why can’t our children that are in the country , why can’t they be the dreamers ?
nobody ever talks about that .
no , no , nobody ever talks about that .
you know , we talk about the dreamers , we talk about illegal immigrants , who by the way are treated better than our vets .
you know , our vets are incredible .
no , no , the illegal immigrants in many _UNK_ treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have – our wounded warriors are – these are the greatest people we have .
and another thing nice about being able to make speeches without having to hire some guy to write and keep writing and reading it and put a _UNK_ then say , `` good morning ladies and gentlemen .
_UNK_ , it’s wonderful – `` you know , is that i can sort of be very current .
okay ?
i can be very , very current .
i can talk about what’s happening .
this morning on the television , they had a whole story about the veterans administration and the hospitals how people are waiting on lines to get in .
these are our veterans .
these are the people that got hurt fighting for us .
maybe we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them , to be honest with you .
i mean , that’s possible too .
they had a story this morning on fox , on cnn and a number of them where the veterans are just treated _UNK_ and they showed a desk where there’s supposed to be people behind this desk and they showed this desk and there’s nobody there .
and the veterans – i don’t know , probably some of you saw it , the veterans are saying `` where are the people ? ''
and then , they said , `` what happened ? ''
and they said , `` this happens all the time . ''
there was not even – nobody even there !
and two weeks ago on wednesday , they had the longest wait in the history – in the history of the veterans administration for people wanting to see a doctor .
when i go to a doctor , if i have to wait like 9 minutes , i’m like `` get me – `` i’d go _UNK_ .
it’s true .
remember the old days when the doctor used to come to your house ?
right ?
_UNK_ _UNK_ that .
you’d have a cold .
the doctor would come over carrying a little _UNK_ like this big , beautiful little _UNK_ , being at the top .
and he’d come over to your house , check you out , fine .
those days don’t exist anymore .
you know , we’re in age of obamacare where nothing exists .
by the way , we will repeal and replace obamacare .
that i can tell you .
that i can tell you .
but , so two weeks ago wednesday , the longest wait in the history of the veterans administration .
so that if you go to the _UNK_ office , men and women are waiting four days , three days , one was five days .
one case was five days or six days , finally got to see the doctor and the doctor _UNK_ himself because he was going on vacation .
now , you think about that .
can you imagine waiting even a day or a half a day ?
but these people are waiting four , five days .
so the _UNK_ now the longest in history and that’s the way we’re treating our greatest people and that’s not right and we’re going to change that .
we’re going to change that .
we have right now – and people don’t know this .
you know , they see these _UNK_ statistics put out by politicians basically .
all talk , no action politicians .
and i mean on both sides in all fairness .
you know , i’m a republican .
i’m a conservative .
but i’m just as angry with the republicans because they go to washington , something happens – they become weak .
you know , they go to washington – `` we’re going to stop obamacare .
we’re going to stop this .
we’re going to do this .
we’re going to do that . ''
then they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible _UNK_ _UNK_ , and they go `` oh , i made it , _UNK_ , i made it .
i vote for you .
i vote for you .
i vote for obamacare _UNK_ .
i’ll do whatever you want me to do .
i’m in washington . ''
it’s amazing .
isn’t it amazing ?
don’t you agree ?
i won’t happen to me , i promise .
and if it does , you can let me know about it .
but it won’t .
i promise .
i promise .
but you know , they show those _UNK_ statistics where we’re _UNK_ % unemployment .
_UNK_ % .
the real number .
you know , i actually saw a number it could be _UNK_ % , okay , believe it or not .
but when you think about it , we have _UNK_ million people that are right now out of the labor force .
_UNK_ million people .
of the _UNK_ many of these people want jobs .
and they quit looking .
so if you’re looking for a job and you can’t find it and you stop for a while – you know , after a while you sort of like `` it’s not happening .
it’s not going to happen . ''
i don’t know what they do .
but they stop .
they are considered _UNK_ _UNK_ .
okay ?
so , we have _UNK_ million people out of the labor force .
i mean , think about it .
it’s hard to believe .
we have 50 million people in poverty .
these are very new numbers .
50 million people in poverty .
taking our money .
_UNK_ taking our money .
mexico is _UNK_ us at the border and on trade .
by the way , they’re killing us on trade .
you know that .
in fact , you just lost a big car plant to mexico in tennessee .
remember ?
recently front page wall street _UNK_ .
a plant that you were going to _UNK_ [ comment on a _UNK_ sign ] you know this is a movement , folks .
this is not like maybe even about me .
i don’t want it to be about me .
this is about common sense .
it’s about doing the right thing .
one of the things that came out in the poll , which was really amazing .
some of the polls , i mean , hey , in iowa , we’re leading big .
those are great people .
we just left iowa .
we had such an amazing evening .
_UNK_ people in a room that never had that many people and it was a happening .
we just left alabama , which was _UNK_ .
_UNK_ people in a _UNK_ , and it was supposed to _UNK_ .
and it did .
it poured the minute my speech – that’s like luck .
that’s from god .
the minute the speech was over , we got it and it poured .
we had _UNK_ people and it was the most _UNK_ .
and the poll just came out in alabama , leading big in alabama .
leading big in iowa .
leading _UNK_ big in new hampshire .
great people .
leading really big in new hampshire .
leading big in florida .
how about florida ?
i have a governor .
we have a low energy governor and we have a senator and we’re leading big in florida .
how do you do that when you have a senator who’s sitting , you have a governor who’s been there for eight years and trump – ?
i love florida and i’m there a lot .
what could be in florida ?
great weather .
you have great weather but florida has great weather .
big advantage .
but you know , i’m leading big in florida .
but one of the polls came out because in south carolina and north carolina , i’m leading really big .
and in south carolina , a poll came out and we had a statement that my level of _UNK_ or _UNK_ – you know , i’m the only one that can get a poll and it comes out and these guys in the back with all those red lights on will say – i think i had one poll where i’m _UNK_ % – almost _UNK_ % – can you imagine ?
_UNK_ % .
there’s 17 people .
so i’m at _UNK_ % with 17 people and they said `` _UNK_ at _UNK_ % but look '' – you can’t even hear it .
you know , `` trump says _UNK_ '' .
nobody knows what they just said .
`` but there are some people that don’t like him . ''
it’s _UNK_ .
i’m the only one that _UNK_ these polls and i get negative _UNK_ .
no , it’s incredible .
the press , _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , yesterday , you might have seen me .
i was in south carolina .
i made a speech .
i had to bring it up .
the new york times to me is a big deal .
you know , i’m from new york .
very liberal paper but that’s okay .
you know , not everybody could be like us .
but it’s still the new york times .
right ?
we have to admit , still the new york times .
and i’m on the front page a lot on the new york times , and to be on the front page of the new york times is a big deal .
but yesterday or two days ago , they had story about me and they had some low level hispanic _UNK_ .
low level guy .
this one didn’t like me .
by the way , i think i’m going to win the hispanic vote and i think – you know , in nevada , i won the hispanic poll .
they love me .
i love the hispanic people .
incredible energy .
incredible people .
i love the people .
i have so many – i have thousands that work for me and thousands and thousands over the years and have worked for me .
they’re great people .
and i said , `` i’m going to win '' .
and a lot of the _UNK_ that are here legally , they don’t want people coming in illegally .
you know it’s true .
it’s true .
so there’s this poll that comes out .
i think it was in south carolina where we’re way up and _UNK_ at 4 % and he’s the senator .
i’m at 30 % .
so i wrote him a note , `` congratulations .
i’m only _UNK_ you in your home state by 26 points . ''
so _UNK_ , who cares .
but they did something that nobody reported .
they say , `` oh but do people like trump ? ''
by the way , this election is not going to be like .
i think i’m a nice person .
i love people .
i want to help people .
women’s health issues to me are very important .
to _UNK_ bush it wasn’t important because he didn’t want to fund them .
and then he said , `` oh , i _UNK_ . ''
but you know , i really want to be a nice person and i am a nice person .
but i think it’s actually going to be an election based on _UNK_ .
we’re tired of being like the _UNK_ for everybody .
i really do .
i think it’s time .
but in the poll , this was the _UNK_ poll .
big poll .
highly _UNK_ – `` in another act of political _UNK_ managed to _UNK_ his _UNK_ rating from negative '' – nobody wrote this by the way .
nobody said it .
nobody reported it .
`` from negative to positive . ''
this is an _UNK_ quote .
i have like this _UNK_ memory so i don’t need – but i want to be sure because if i used the word `` the '' _UNK_ , they’ll say , `` he didn’t – `` '' _UNK_ rating from negative to positive in one poll during the span of a month '' .
a _UNK_ that _UNK_ _UNK_ patrick _UNK_ highly respected _UNK_ called `` _UNK_ '' .
called it `` _UNK_ . ''
nobody else wrote about it .
`` that _UNK_ any rule in presidential politics that i’ve ever seen , '' said this highly respected man .
_UNK_ , the director of the polling institute , said he _UNK_ it from 20 % to _UNK_ % in one month and he said that he’s never seen that before .
and you know what ?
that’s because people have heard me and they say `` you’re such a nice person . ''
no , they want – they say he’s a man – i’ve made a tremendous amount of money .
i’ve had tremendous success .
and i don’t say that _UNK_ .
that’s the kind of thinking we need in the country .
i mean , whatever it is .
but to me , that statement was more important than actually literally killing everybody in the poll .
we were much , much higher , more than double everybody .
and we are more than double everybody .
you saw the _UNK_ just came out and that was an amazing poll .
i was the same thing .
much , much higher – double and triple and _UNK_ many of these candidates .
and the reason is people in this country are smart .
they don’t believe a lot of what they see in the media because if you believe these people – you know , why are they doing this ?
i mean , why are they even saying it ?
you’d think that if _UNK_ good for the country – and i’ll be great for the country because i’m going to make great deals for our country .
we don’t win anymore .
our country doesn’t win anymore .
you’d think somebody – even a liberal person or a democrat liberal and i mean , really liberal .
somebody who’s going to make the country – why are they _UNK_ it ?
why are they _UNK_ ?
why do they fight ?
you’d think they’d say `` let’s do it .
it’s good .
it’s good for all of us . ''
because our country is in trouble .
we owe now $ 19 trillion .
you know , i’ve been saying $ 18 [ trillion ] for a while now .
but now it starts to go up quickly .
and by the way , when obamacare _UNK_ in , which is really _UNK_ in in _UNK_ , you want to see bad deficits ?
you want to see it go up ?
you’re going to really see it go up because that has a huge negative impact not only on jobs but on the deficit itself because of the costs .
and it’s no good .
have you noticed – and you’ve seen it yourself – the premiums have gone through the roof ?
right ?
the _UNK_ – unless you’re close to death , you’re never going to use it .
you can’t use it because the _UNK_ is so high .
but the premiums are up 30 % , 40 % , and 50 % and more .
it’s a disaster .
and on top of that , it’s going to cost the country a fortune .
so it’s not only _UNK_ you a lot of money , it’s going to cost the country a fortune .
so we have to do something about it .
and we have to do something importantly about it .
but when i see the people on television and i have to tell you i won’t mention names , some of them when they hear my name – i was talking – we have a great reporter today from the wall street _UNK_ with us .
okay ?
who came down .
and she actually said `` some of them when they hear your name it looks like they’re a _UNK_ waiting to _UNK_ . ''
it’s true .
_UNK_ , number one , they look bad because they said – do you remember the beginning ?
like three , four months ago .
they said , `` he’s a _UNK_ .
he’s a _UNK_ .
just having fun . ''
you know , i went to a great school .
i did great .
i did – everything was great .
i came out .
i made a fortune , which i want to use the brain for you , but i made a fortune .
i then did a book called the _UNK_ of the deal and many _UNK_ .
the _UNK_ of the deal being probably the best selling business book of all time .
who has read the _UNK_ of the deal ?
yeah , most people .
most everybody .
i _UNK_ say but i mean it – the _UNK_ _UNK_ it by a long way .
i say that .
i say that .
said it the first time in iowa .
people liked that .
but it’s true .
nothing _UNK_ the _UNK_ .
but the _UNK_ of the deal – great success .
many books – _UNK_ .
many , many _UNK_ .
then i do the _UNK_ .
i’ve never done television .
i do the _UNK_ .
it’s one of the most successful shows ever on television by the way .
and _UNK_ renewed the _UNK_ .
you know that .
right ?
for me .
they came up to my office , the head of _UNK_ – great guy – i won’t use names .
just say `` steve '' .
no , honestly he’s a great guy .
one of the best in the country .
he came up with the heads of _UNK_ six months ago and they said , `` donald , we’re renewing the _UNK_ .
please , you’ll have to do – you have to do it . ''
i said , `` honestly , steve , i’m running for president .
i want to make our country great again .
i want to make - '' and they didn’t believe me .
and i said it four times .
they didn’t believe me .
nobody believed that i was going to run .
nobody .
my wife didn’t even believe me , but now she does .
but she actually said `` if you actually say you’re going to run , you’re going to do great because people like you . ''
she actually said `` they’d love you '' but i don’t want to _UNK_ .
but she said , `` if you actually run – not you may run , you may not run , who knows ? ''
but she said `` if you actually say - '' so the _UNK_ guys come up – terrific people .
i mean , honestly i had a great relationship with _UNK_ for 12 years .
we had many , many , you know number ones and the _UNK_ continues to do great .
you know , last season you know how well it did .
so they wanted to renew it for many , many shows .
in fact , mark _UNK_ called up .
you know mark _UNK_ .
he did _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
so mark _UNK_ , who’s a great guy , he calls up and he goes `` i don’t believe it .
you’re not taking a renewal . ''
the word is renewal .
i said , `` that’s right , mark .
i’m going to run for president . ''
`` no , no , no , you have to – nobody doesn’t take a renewal .
it’s _UNK_ of in _UNK_ television .
two hours _UNK_ .
are you _UNK_ ? ''
i said , `` mark , i have to do this .
i’ve done so well in this country .
i have to do it . ''
we can save our country .
we can save our country .
so _UNK_ , the bottom line , _UNK_ renewed it .
i told them i’m not doing it , and then they finally believed me when i actually announced .
they don’t like me anymore .
it’s amazing .
they do not like me .
but it’s too bad .
too bad .
well , thank you .
you know , the funny thing about the _UNK_ – there have been 15 _UNK_ of the _UNK_ .
every single one of them failed .
so then a reporter said to me , `` why do you think that is ? ''
i said `` because i’m special . ''
and i was _UNK_ .
i was doing it _UNK_ – i mean , i sort of meant it to be honest , right ?
but i was sort of _UNK_ .
and they wrote it and i hated the way it looked in writing .
you know , it sounds good when you say it but oh it looks so bad in writing .
but so i had a great experience .
so here i am – great schools , great brain , great success , built a great company , do the _UNK_ , tremendous success .
when i did the _UNK_ , a certain _UNK_ said `` it will never be successful '' because you know to have a big hit – a really a number one hit – you have to – and you remember that first season it had one of the highest ratings ever .
the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ !
remember with the great bill _UNK_ .
remember how that was ?
incredible .
but to have a great success , you have to have women .
and i’ll never forget – i saved the article .
right ?
like harry truman saved it where it said , `` truman _UNK_ '' and he actually won .
remember ?
but i saved this article .
they said `` trump can never succeed on television because why would women want to watch donald trump ? ''
and i said , `` am i so bad ?
am i so bad ? ''
tell me , am i so bad ?
and it turned out that women were the biggest base .
i mean , those were the ones that _UNK_ you know i saved those things .
but no matter how you cut it , we can do something so incredible .
and honestly , it’s going to be hard .
it’s going to be a lot of work .
it’s going to be a lot of time .
i wouldn’t leave the white house .
you know , obama always leaves the white house .
think of it .
you’re elected president .
you’re in the white house .
why would you want to leave ?
i think i’d maybe never leave !
how cool is that ?
he leaves to go to some place and go _UNK_ .
i’ll try – i don’t know maybe there’s some rules against it .
so maybe i can’t .
but i’ll do the _UNK_ in the white house .
he and his wife left – i think one was doing the _UNK_ show another was doing another show right next door in _UNK_ , california .
they left a couple of hours difference .
one took air force one ; one took a beautiful _UNK_ _UNK_ two planes .
a little bit different _UNK_ going to the same _UNK_ , going to the same airport to do different shows .
and i say why ?
why aren’t they flying at least the same plane ?
now , i know what those _UNK_ cost because i happen to have one of them right ?
so i know what it costs to operate these _UNK_ importantly , the time and the energy .
but i would have said _UNK_ or i would have said whoever was doing the show , `` let’s do it from the white house . ''
this way , i take a half and hour , i go back , i don’t spend any money of the taxpayers .
_UNK_ you know the funny thing is that whoever the host is would like it better .
`` we’re doing our show live from the white house or something '' .
so we don’t pay any money .
we don’t have to fuel up air force one , which costs you – do you ever see what it costs to travel in these things ?
with hundreds and hundreds of security and you’re closing down _UNK_ , california .
i mean , every time obama comes to manhattan to do a _UNK_ , which is often , i say `` what’s going on ?
you can’t move .
they closed down all the streets .
they closed down the city . ''
and he could do it from like washington .
in fact , he could do it in my new _UNK_ that i’m buying which is only a couple of blocks .
_UNK_ true .
i’m building this incredible _UNK_ on pennsylvania avenue and it’s going to be incredible .
the old post office .
and i actually got it from the obama administration , which is hard to believe .
people say `` what’s going on ?
how did trump get it ? ''
one of the most heavily sought after buildings in the history of the general services administration , which owned it .
you know , they’re the ones that made the decision .
and i got it and we’re building this _UNK_ _UNK_ – trump international _UNK_ – right on pennsylvania avenue directly between congress and the white house .
right ?
it’s going to open just in time – and by the way , listen to this one .
we’re under budget and ahead of schedule .
do you ever hear that from government ?
way under budget .
so we’re actually going to be opening and _UNK_ be great .
but he can use my _UNK_ .
i’ll let him use it free .
you just come in , use it , go back to the white house .
but you don’t have to do that .
but you’d say to yourself why – you know , it’s a _UNK_ .
but more importantly even in the travel , we have so many things that we have to do to _UNK_ out our country .
you don’t want to waste time .
you’ve got to do this .
you’ve got to make deals .
i’ve got the greatest deal makers in the world lined up to make deals for us .
carl _UNK_ – incredible guy .
right ?
incredible guy .
great deal _UNK_ .
i’ve got some of the greatest deal makers in the world .
they’re all calling me too .
they said `` you didn’t ask me . ''
i have these guys calling me up – the best in the world .
now , i know the best .
i also know guys that are _UNK_ .
i know guys that you haven’t heard of that honestly are _UNK_ .
i know a lot that you have heard of that aren’t really that good , that are _UNK_ in my opinion .
but they’re the best in the world .
and they’re calling me .
they don’t want money .
they’re worth billions of dollars .
but when i put , let’s say , carl _UNK_ and i’ll say `` carl , do me a favor .
handle china . ''
we’re going to make a great deal .
no , no , we’re going to make a great deal because that’s what happens .
you know , that’s what happens .
so , we’re going to take back our trade .
if you look at china , if you look at japan – i was in los _UNK_ a few weeks ago .
i saw ships – the biggest ships i’ve ever seen with cars _UNK_ our , _UNK_ out one after another , made in japan , very nice .
_UNK_ nice .
except that it doesn’t help us .
when does it help us ?
when does it help us ?
we sell them _UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
and then they don’t want it .
because you know , do you ever see what’s going on over there ?
we sell the _UNK_ and it goes over there and it’s very _UNK_ .
so by the time it gets over there , then they turn it over `` we don’t want it . ''
they have cars coming from these massive , massive ships .
massive .
and they just _UNK_ off the ships .
and i say , `` what are we doing ?
how _UNK_ are we ?
no tax , no nothing . ''
and i’m a free _UNK_ .
i believe in free trade .
i have to say .
but i have to be fair trade .
when you look at japan , they take in money up here and we give them money down here .
we get nothing by comparison .
it’s like _UNK_ .
balance it out , _UNK_ .
balance it out .
got to balance it .
a friend of mine is a great manufacturer .
as you know , china has – it’s probably the greatest theft in the history of the united states what china has done to us .
they’ve taken our money .
they’ve taken our jobs .
they’ve taken everything .
they’ve taken so much .
and they’re creating a bubble and you know _UNK_ we’re so _UNK_ that now the bubble could take us down if it _UNK_ , which at some point it might .
and we’ve got to be smart .
i made so much money dealing with china .
i made hundreds of millions , probably billions , dealing with china .
the bank of america building in san _UNK_ – i own a big chunk of that , which nobody knows .
nobody knows .
you know , all these guys come to _UNK_ .
`` oh , _UNK_ worth only $ 5 billion or $ 4 billion . ''
or whatever .
`` he’s only worth $ 5 billion . ''
it’s like a bankrupt _UNK_ don’t even know my numbers .
they said , `` well , we haven’t been able to look at about 400 of his companies . ''
so i _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , they said `` he’ll never run .
he’ll never run . ''
_UNK_ i announced .
then they said , `` oh , he’ll never file his form whatever . ''
that’s a single page where basically you’re signing your life away and it has to be done within 14 days of the announcement .
i signed my form .
and they said , `` well , he’ll never ever put in his _UNK_ . ''
and you have like 90 days or something .
and they said , `` he’ll ask for _UNK_ but he’ll never show because he’s probably not as rich as people think . ''
but actually i’m much _UNK_ and i put in my _UNK_ – it’s true .
it’s true .
and _UNK_ and another group said , `` no , no , we don’t know what these companies are . ''
i put in these massive _UNK_ , and you know , i was so proud .
i might have _UNK_ if i wasn’t going to run .
i wanted to show people .
i wanted to _UNK_ .
it’s such a great company i’ve built .
so they said , `` he’ll never put in his _UNK_ . ''
i put in the _UNK_ .
and everybody – they’re much bigger .
it’s a much bigger – you know , very little debt , tremendous value .
and really great assets .
iconic assets .
you know , iconic .
_UNK_ , _UNK_ in _UNK_ .
i mean , i have some of the greatest real _UNK_ in the world .
and i’m very proud of it .
but they say , `` he’ll never file .
he’ll never file . ''
then they see all these companies .
and you know , they have _UNK_ .
and because it wasn’t really meant for somebody like me , and they have these little _UNK_ .
they say , `` is it worth or does he make $ 1 million , from $ 1 million to $ 5 million , from $ 5 million to $ 10 million , from $ 10 million to $ 20 million ? ''
the last box is $ 50 million or more .
$ 50 million or more .
so like i have a lot of buildings that are worth much more than that .
i have a lot of assets that are worth much more than that .
so it says `` $ 50 million or more '' .
so i _UNK_ many of them .
i don’t know how many .
i think there’s 23 of them .
can you believe it ?
so i _UNK_ like , i don’t know , i think it’s _UNK_ i could be wrong .
oh , they’ll kill me if i’m wrong .
but i’m not sure .
but i think it’s like 23 _UNK_ .
$ 50 million or more .
so you know when some of these guys do to try and always _UNK_ you ?
they added up 23 _UNK_ .
now , some of the _UNK_ are worth a billion .
some of them are worth more than a billion .
so it says `` $ 50 million or more '' , i go _UNK_ so they’ll take $ 50 million for a building that might be worth a billion and honestly much more .
and they add them up and they say `` well , he’s worth $ _UNK_ billion . ''
it’s really – this is the press .
and they have no _UNK_ .
those statements aren’t really meant for me – it’s not meant for a guy like me .
but with all of that the statements were so good .
they’re so good .
they’re so good .
and you know , one of the things i’m doing and last night was incredible .
we had an amazing event in massachusetts .
right ?
oh , look at this , we have a _UNK_ what the hell are you doing in _UNK_ ?
what are you doing ?
_UNK_ , so here i am .
i spent millions of dollars during the course on jet fuel .
okay ?
like a lot of money on _UNK_ .
but somebody puts up a sign $ 100 to go to this thing .
i didn’t know who did it .
but somebody puts up a sign .
so all over the place , i’m spending millions of dollars .
i’m turning down millions .
i don’t want your money .
i don’t want your money .
somebody puts a sign up talking about $ 100 contribution , which you didn’t have to make .
but they put it up .
it’s all over cnn .
`` trump is asking for $ 100 . ''
i fly my plane some place it costs me a fortune .
the fuel .
the $ 100 .
the money that i raised last night , which says it all it goes towards paying off like the expense or something .
the guy that had it is a great guy – _UNK_ .
a great guy .
really successful guy .
you know him , right ?
_UNK_ .
he’ll sell you a car any day of the week , right ?
and you know the guy is – like 2,000 people showed up .
let him get a little _UNK_ of the _UNK_ _UNK_ or whatever the hell they’re serving .
so they put up a sign .
i don’t want the money .
i might like $ 4 or $ 5 million .
that’s hard to turn down .
but the hundred dollars times some people and we let the vets there , we let most of the people i think came in free .
and i end up with this big story – `` trump accepting contributions '' .
i can’t believe it .
i got so angry at my people .
because somebody put up a sign saying $ 100 .
and honestly , first of all , it’s like _UNK_ .
it doesn’t mean anything .
but they used to it to try and _UNK_ .
they always do .
they always do .
the bottom line is i am _UNK_ my campaign .
i’m _UNK_ .
i don’t want to have anybody giving .
i don’t need money .
now , with that being said , the small money comes in and it’s not a lot of money but it’s great money .
like _UNK_ might send me some money .
_UNK_ will send me some money .
but a woman sent me $ 7 with a beautiful letter from georgia .
another person sent me $ 12 .
small money .
and some sent me $ 1,000 .
but it doesn’t amount to a lot .
but that i do like coming in because they invest in the campaign .
how do i take the $ 7 check , right , and send it back to the person who sent it to me from georgia ?
`` dear so and so , i’m sorry i don’t really want your money . ''
how do you write a letter like that ?
i want them to invest in it .
you know , but they’re not going to tell me not to do this or not to do that for china because they are lobbyists for china and they gave me $ 5 million .
i had a big _UNK_ asked me to have – he wanted to give me $ 5 million for my campaign .
i turned him down .
i turned him down .
and then i see this story on cnn last night .
it was _UNK_ .
that look there’s a sign – $ 100 !
somebody does a sign .
it actually was a beautiful sign if you want to know the truth .
it was so beautiful .
it was _UNK_ done .
and they’re doing this big thing about all day long last night about – i said we had this incredible event and they destroyed it by trying to _UNK_ .
and that’s the press .
that’s the media .
yeah , the criminal media .
i mean , there’s truth to it .
no , because a lot of times they know it’s wrong .
but i just want to tell you so important to me and last night it was such an incredible event .
it had to be a record for a house .
the guy got a beautiful house , got a big _UNK_ , put up a _UNK_ .
but we had 2,000 people .
it had to be a record .
the spirit in that group , the spirit in alabama , the spirit was so incredible .
the spirit in our last meeting in iowa .
don’t forget .
when i went to iowa and you know what i love ?
i’m leading with tea party .
big .
i love tea party .
i love the tea party .
tea party people , stand up and take a _UNK_ .
you have not been treated fairly .
no , you haven’t been treated fairly .
you have not been treated fairly .
you know , people talk about the tea party and you talk about _UNK_ , at least i have a _UNK_ where i can fight back .
you people don’t .
the tea party people are incredible people .
these are people that work hard and they love the country and then they just get beat up all the time by the media .
it’s _UNK_ .
and you will be surprised how big you are .
you don’t know how big you are .
you don’t know the power that you have .
i mean it .
you don’t know the power that you have .
the tea party and you can call it anything that you want .
i don’t care about names .
but the tea party has tremendous power .
i talked silent majority .
but the silent majority is more than tea party .
it’s democrats .
it’s poor people .
it’s rich people .
it’s everybody .
it’s _UNK_ .
one of the things that made me so happy – i’m a _UNK_ .
i’m a _UNK_ .
right ?
– is that i had a recent poll and they did a beautiful – like these polls are great .
you know , guys like _UNK_ bush and hillary , they hire _UNK_ .
they pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars .
what do you have to do that for ?
every week they come out with a new poll .
right ?
hey , i’m rich .
i could hire a hundred poll .
i don’t want to waste money .
you know , why should i pay ?
i know in one _UNK_ $ 150,000 a month .
and you know , then they’re _UNK_ guys .
they think they’re _UNK_ stuff and they tell the candidates what to say .
`` you’ve got to say this .
you’ve got to be politically correct . ''
no way .
i don’t have time to be political .
no , it’s true .
it’s true .
i don’t have time to be political .
you know , it takes a lot of time to be politically correct .
you saw the anchor baby thing .
did you see that with where i’m on ?
and somebody _UNK_ the same network – cnn again – he said , `` you know the name anchor baby is very _UNK_ ? ''
i said , `` what would you call it ? ''
and he gave me like nine words .
`` a baby of illegal immigrant who was brought to the country to this and that . ''
i said , `` how can i say that ?
it’s too long . ''
it’s anchor baby .
and then bush – _UNK_ .
_UNK_ bush gets caught because he is such a nice person .
honestly .
if you want a nice person , honestly you should vote for _UNK_ .
the country is going to go to hell but we won’t talk of that .
no , no , but if you want a nice person .
so _UNK_ has a _UNK_ that he signed of basically a politically correct _UNK_ .
you know , don’t say this , don’t say that .
all these things .
pages of stuff .
but one of the things – `` never use the term _UNK_ _UNK_ . ''
so all of a sudden , he’s using the term anchor baby just last week .
and with me , when i use it nobody _UNK_ me .
they expect me .
they gave up .
okay ?
with him , they killed him .
they just killed him .
it didn’t stop .
and then he blamed it on the _UNK_ .
he said , you know – did you see that ?
and then the new york times did an _UNK_ `` how _UNK_ you attack the _UNK_ ? ''
so he wanted to _UNK_ away from the _UNK_ .
he said , `` well , you know , the _UNK_ come in and they also have anchor _UNK_ . ''
and now the _UNK_ all hate him .
it’s true .
but the _UNK_ love me and i love them .
i love them .
so he has a _UNK_ and he signs the _UNK_ and it says – a couple of years ago – `` don’t use this term '' , and now he’s using it because he has to .
because baby – you know , think of it .
think of it .
i want to build a wall .
okay ?
so easy .
so easy .
when this _UNK_ – _UNK_ _UNK_ or whatever the hell his name – no , he’s a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ .
actually _UNK_ _UNK_ is a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
he’s a nice _UNK_ _UNK_ .
but when _UNK_ got up the other day screaming and _UNK_ and going _UNK_ and i had all these reporters .
actually , the reporters were mostly on my side because they all had their hand up but this guy starts screaming .
so i even had liberal people from _UNK_ – i actually said to the _UNK_ guy `` yes ? ''
and this guy stands up and starts screaming .
so when he – and i actually got a lot of credit for the way we handled him .
i didn’t do anything like – i didn’t do anything .
except for the times .
and that’s what i _UNK_ to before .
the times said , `` donald trump _UNK_ at him and _UNK_ at him . ''
i didn’t _UNK_ at him .
but he was screaming at me .
and much worse than that , they said i wore a _UNK_ .
can you believe it ?
i don’t wear a _UNK_ , and i proved it – i won’t bring anybody up .
i won’t bring anybody up .
but i don’t .
but think of it .
i’m in the front page of the new york times and in the first sentence in the first _UNK_ has this _UNK_ – this hispanic _UNK_ that nobody ever heard of – saying they called him something which means he wears a _UNK_ .
and i don’t .
so , i’m on the front page of the new york times .
i can’t even talk about it .
i’m _UNK_ to talk about it .
but they also said , i was essentially screaming at this guy from _UNK_ , who i happen to be _UNK_ for $ 500 million .
they didn’t mention that .
they also didn’t mention that his daughter works for hillary clinton .
did you know that ?
his daughter works for hillary clinton .
oh , you didn’t know that .
oh .
no , they didn’t mention that .
no , no .
they said i was _UNK_ a _UNK_ and i was screaming but they didn’t .
no , he’s screaming at me .
so we very _UNK_ – and then we let him come back and we actually had a nice talk .
he actually seemed like a nice guy after he _UNK_ down a little bit .
you know , he’s a very emotional man .
but , he said , `` you can’t build a wall because you can’t do it . ''
so , 2,000 years ago in china – we always get back to china – 2,000 years ago , the great wall of china – oh , we’d like to have a wall .
this is a serious wall .
okay ?
this is a wall you don’t go through so easy .
they built a wall 2,000 years ago that’s _UNK_ miles .
think of that .
that’s a big wall .
that’s serious wall , right ?
this was 2,000 years ago .
i mean , it took them like 500 years to build it so you know , i got to be a little bit – you know , took a long time .
but _UNK_ miles that’s a long time .
they had no _UNK_ .
they didn’t have _UNK_ .
of course , today , we use _UNK_ because they’re made in japan and you could buy them cheaper .
how _UNK_ is that ?
because they _UNK_ the _UNK_ so much and people are buying _UNK_ instead of _UNK_ .
_UNK_ stock is down .
it’s terrible .
we’ll change that around .
believe me .
believe me .
but , they build this wall .
now , we have really 15 – i would say – look we have 2,000 miles as opposed to _UNK_ but you don’t need it on all of it because some you have natural _UNK_ , some you have a lot of places .
and actually 10 years ago , everybody wanted the wall built .
hillary wanted it built .
but they couldn’t .
because i’m a great _UNK_ .
what i do best is build .
i’m not a _UNK_ guy .
i do the building and then do the _UNK_ .
a lot of these guys come in with _UNK_ and it never gets built .
does that make sense to anybody ?
i’m the opposite .
i get it built .
so , one of the reasons it couldn’t get built is because they couldn’t get an approved environmental impact study .
do you believe this ?
no , no , they had certain _UNK_ _UNK_ and different things .
they couldn’t get it .
they could not get an environmental impact study approved to build a wall .
and they’re killing people .
we have illegal immigrants .
you see that with _UNK_ in san _UNK_ .
you see it with _UNK_ .
you see it with so many people .
last night in massachusetts i met some _UNK_ families that have been devastated by illegal immigrants .
they come into this country and kill members of their family .
last week in california , a _UNK_ veteran – a _UNK_ , a veteran , _UNK_ – got _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , and killed .
_UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , and killed .
_UNK_ .
by an illegal immigrant that they caught , that they caught _UNK_ .
but this is what we have .
we have _UNK_ people in our government and we have people _UNK_ across the border .
and you know what ?
we have great border patrol people .
i went there .
you probably saw that .
that’s why the _UNK_ is so successful .
the white one , right ?
but i went there , everybody wants to buy the _UNK_ .
now they like the white one .
then two weeks later , i wore the red one .
the white one didn’t sell so well .
the red one _UNK_ .
_UNK_ thing .
but i went to the border and i got to know the people and i saw people , and you know it’s rough stuff , it’s rough stuff .
and when i first came in and when i first did my opening statement that i was running for president , i talked about illegal immigration .
i was killed by the press .
rush _UNK_ , who i think is a terrific guy , said `` trump has received more incoming than any human being i’ve ever seen .
then he goes and has a news conference and i think he’s going to apologize and he _UNK_ down . ''
i got credit .
i got credit .
no , they thought i was going to apologize .
and i don’t mind _UNK_ but i have to make a mistake to apologize and i was right .
no , i was right .
so for two weeks , as rush said , i took _UNK_ fact that was my first two weeks .
i said `` is it going to be like this for the next year and a half ? ''
i don’t know if i can make it .
it was brutal .
now , many of those people that talked that way , many of those people , they’ve _UNK_ to me .
everybody says i’m right .
and only because of me is everybody talking about illegal immigration .
they wouldn’t even be talking about it .
they wouldn’t even be talking about it .
and we’re going to build a wall and we’re going to get , you know , the _UNK_ members in _UNK_ and in chicago and these are some tough _UNK_ .
they’re going to be out so fast .
one of the first thing i’m going to do is get rid of those _UNK_ members .
we’re going to be – you know , you look at what’s going on with _UNK_ , you look at what’s going on in chicago and ferguson and st. _UNK_ the other night .
we are going to get rid of those _UNK_ members so fast your head will _UNK_ .
you know , we can be very tough .
i just met your cops outside .
those police are tough _UNK_ .
those guys – we need law and order .
we need law and order .
i mean , they allowed – in one night , that first night in _UNK_ – they allowed that city to be destroyed .
and they set it back 35 years .
one night .
because the police were not allowed to protect people .
they weren’t allowed to protect people .
we have incredible law enforcement in this country and we have to be – the head of the police in chicago is a person i know .
originally from new york .
he’s a _UNK_ guy .
he can stop things if they’re allowed to stop them .
he can stop it .
believe me .
we have some incredible people .
but we have to be tough .
we have to be smart .
you know , i know you’re going to have some bad _UNK_ .
you’re going to have problems .
i see some of the things .
you did too and it’s _UNK_ and it’s _UNK_ .
but that’s such a tiny percentage .
the problem is the good work doesn’t get shown on television .
all of the good work , which is _UNK_ % .
i mean , the good work with the police .
it’s _UNK_ % .
that one little thing .
and it’s _UNK_ .
i agree .
i hated some of the things .
i don’t have to go into them .
but you know the same ones because you were sick when you looked at some of them just like i was .
but we need law and order .
we need our police .
they’re great people .
they do a _UNK_ job .
they’re right now afraid of doing anything .
they’re afraid .
i mean , i know cities .
i won’t mention names but i know cities where police are afraid to even talk to people because they want to be able to retire and have their pension ; they don’t want to be thrown off the police force .
and then you wonder why there’s crimes in our cities .
so we need a whole new _UNK_ .
we have to build up our military .
we have to make our military so strong .
we have to make our military so powerful and so strong that we never have to use it .
we never have to use it .
we also have to focus on what we have – look , ukraine .
i want ukraine to be healthy , vibrant and good .
but ukraine is near germany and all of these european countries .
we’re now sending _UNK_ .
that’s the newest fighters .
the best in the world .
we’re sending fighters every – where’s germany ?
where are all these european countries ?
it affects them .
it affects them .
and we want to stand alongside of them .
i agree .
but why are we leading the fight ?
putin _UNK_ us .
he _UNK_ obama .
he doesn’t hate us .
i think he’d like me .
i’d get along great with him i think if you want to know the truth .
no , he has no respect for our president and our president doesn’t like him in all fairness .
they don’t have good _UNK_ to put it _UNK_ , would you say .
but i’d get along with these people .
think of it .
every country is _UNK_ us off .
even russia is _UNK_ us off because in the iran deal , which is going to go down as one of the worst deals ever , russia is a big _UNK_ because they’re going to sell iran missiles with the money we give to iran .
think of that .
so one of the biggest _UNK_ is russia .
okay ?
but think of it .
so , ukraine – let’s take a few of these things and then i’m getting the hell out of here ; i’m going back to new york .
do you mind ?
maybe i’ll go to the grand _UNK_ _UNK_ tonight .
can i do that ?
i’d actually rather – i love – by the way , this is not a politician speaking .
believe me .
i hope .
i love country music .
i love it .
hey , _UNK_ _UNK_ – right ?
and who else won on the _UNK_ ?
who else ?
john rich .
my kids love those two guys .
john rich .
and who else ?
who did really well ?
_UNK_ black .
right ?
_UNK_ black .
he did great .
and my _UNK_ – how good is _UNK_ , okay ?
you know , _UNK_ came onto the _UNK_ .
and i said , `` who the hell is he ?
who is he ? ''
i didn’t know who _UNK_ was .
i’d never heard of him .
and he wasn’t a big name .
and he came on – just to show you how important this show is and his record or _UNK_ or whatever you call it _UNK_ went to number one .
and then he came to me the next _UNK_ _UNK_ came to me and he goes – you know , at certain _UNK_ show , i won’t mention the name – but he said `` last year , i couldn’t get into the show and this year i’m hosting it , mr. trump , all because of you . ''
nice , right ?
i know , nice .
but those three guys , they’re great and they’re just _UNK_ people .
but we’ve got to make our country so strong .
we have to make our country rich again .
a person came up and said , `` oh , that’s not nice . ''
what’s not nice ?
they said rich , you know , to say we’re going to make our country rich .
we can’t make our country great if we’re going to be poor .
we’re a _UNK_ nation .
we owe $ 19 trillion .
china – think of this – china we owe $ _UNK_ trillion to .
so they come in , they take our jobs , they take our money , they take our base , they take our manufacturing and we owe them $ _UNK_ trillion .
how do you do that ?
that’s like a magic act .
right ?
it’s true .
japan _UNK_ us cars by the millions .
they make a fortune .
they come in , they sell us cars by the millions .
and we owe them the _UNK_ same amount .
we owe them $ _UNK_ trillion .
how come if they’re selling us cars we owe them money ?
think of it .
put on your business .
see ?
i have a natural instinct for this stuff .
right ?
you know ?
right ?
if we buy all these cars , why do we owe them money ?
but we owe them because they take all our money that they make and they buy our bonds .
and we’re paying interests on them and we owe them money .
so , _UNK_ change .
it can change .
it’s not even going to be hard .
people don’t realize .
see , obama never read the _UNK_ of the deal .
people don’t realize .
oh , and somebody said _UNK_ .
it was _UNK_ .
where’s _UNK_ ?
she gave me such a hard time .
where’s _UNK_ ?
where the hell is she ?
you could have both _UNK_ stand up actually .
where are they ?
both of them .
_UNK_ is great .
oh , did they go after _UNK_ took a lot of incoming .
_UNK_ , did you take a lot of incoming ?
i think so .
right ?
thank you , _UNK_ .
so , we are going to do something that if i get elected – and again they said i’ll never run and _UNK_ guy said – john _UNK_ – you ever watch the _UNK_ report ?
i like him .
and one of the people on the little group said donald trump is a great _UNK_ but he’ll never make it as a president .
he’ll never get elected .
he’ll never make it .
and john _UNK_ – this _UNK_ guy who i like ; i don’t know him .
i never met him , i don’t think .
but i like .
he’s sitting there and he goes – and he got angry – he goes `` why wouldn’t he make it ?
you tell me why .
he’s been a tremendous success in everything he’s done .
i go all over the world .
i see him name .
i see his name all over .
he’s a great success . ''
and he said – i think this is the word – `` he’s a man of great achievement .
why wouldn’t he make it ? ''
and i thought it was so nice and the other guy just sort of shut up .
you know , because you need somebody of great achievement .
you need – i’ve produced tens of thousands of jobs over the year .
i don’t have to worry about obamacare .
i take such good care of my employees .
i have thousands of employees .
i take good care of them .
we have great plans .
my employees are lucky .
they hit the _UNK_ , okay ?
but i take great care – education and health care – and my people are very happy .
but i’ve done this for a long time , and i’ve seen ups and downs .
i’ve seen market _UNK_ .
i’ve seen friends of mine go bankrupt .
you’ve never seen – i’ve never gone bankrupt .
by the way , i’ve used the laws to my advantage and companies .
i buy a company .
i throw it into a chapter .
i negotiate with banks .
i kill .
you know .
and then they say `` trump goes bankrupt . ''
these people – they don’t have any – now , when other people do that , when a carl does it – i mean , they do it all the time .
they use it all the time .
it’s called using your head .
it’s called using the laws .
actually i did a good job didn’t i at the debate when chris _UNK_ so _UNK_ said – i do what every other great _UNK_ does .
i buy a company – you know , it’s one company was sort of interesting .
a friend of mine had it .
good guy .
and the banks were just killing him .
they were mean .
and banks can be mean , right ?
you’ve got to teach them how to _UNK_ , right ?
so this guy was just getting beaten .
and i did him a favor and i called up the banks .
and i said `` do me this , do this , do this , do that . ''
they said , `` we won’t do that .
no , we won’t do that . ''
i said , `` you’re making a mistake . ''
_UNK_ , it’s sort of a little bit _UNK_ bought it .
immediately , i called them back and said , `` don’t do this . ''
i threw it into a chapter .
and they come out with the story `` trump _UNK_ bankruptcy '' .
can you believe it ?
i negotiated it to hell .
what i did to that bank – _UNK_ .
they see me walking down the street and they go `` hey , hey , hey . ''
but then i’m good at that stuff , you know ?
i’m really good at that stuff .
but you have to use the laws to your advantage .
no , no , you have to use it to your advantage .
atlantic city .
you know , you look at atlantic city .
_UNK_ went bankrupt .
whoever heard of _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ _UNK_ chapter _UNK_ nobody cares .
everybody in atlantic city .
i had the good sense seven years ago and actually the financial media gives me great credit because i have a vision for things .
i said , `` don’t go into iraq '' even though i’m a very _UNK_ person .
i said `` don’t go into iraq '' and they shouldn’t have because i said you’re going to _UNK_ the middle east .
so what did we get – $ 2 trillion .
thousands of deaths .
thousands .
like _UNK_ wounded warriors who i love all over the place .
we can’t even go there .
iran is taking over iraq .
with the money that we’re giving them , they’re going to take off and they’re going to get the oil , they’re going to get everything .
the oil they don’t get isis is getting .
what do we get ?
nothing .
we get nothing .
we got far less than nothing .
so i had vision in _UNK_ – _UNK_ – actually it was before that but they wrote a story .
trump says don’t do iraq .
now , i’m much more _UNK_ than bush , even the brother .
but you got to know where to use it and when .
you got to use .
so with atlantic city , seven years ago , i got out .
that’s called vision .
i should get credit for vision .
and again , this isn’t _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , i wouldn’t say this but i need your _UNK_ votes .
do you understand that ?
do you understand that ?
i mean , _UNK_ i wouldn’t .
so i got great credit .
i got out .
but most of the places in atlantic city are either in trouble or they’re bankrupt .
they went bankrupt .
but i made a lot of money in atlantic city .
i had a great time in atlantic city but they asked me a _UNK_ question , i gave a great answer .
i thought .
so i think i solved it .
listen , we are going to do things that are going to make you so proud if i win .
we are going to have victories again .
we are going to win .
in fact , last night in front of the audience and i’ve never said this before .
last night in front of the audience i said we’re going to have so many victories .
and then i said we’re going to win here .
we’re going to win on trade .
we’re going to win _UNK_ in terms of not having wars but just having such great strength that _UNK_ going to play with us .
_UNK_ going to mess with us .
okay ?
nobody .
and we’re going to have victories .
so many victories that are going to be coming _UNK_ fact , you might get tired of victories .
you may not want _UNK_ everyone stood up and said `` no , no , no , we want to keep winning . ''
if i win , we will have victories all over .
we will win on trade .
we will win on health care .
we will win on everything .
i will protect your social security without cuts .
i will protect your medicare and your medicaid .
we are going to have something that’s so special .
and you know , my whole fame is and i’ll say it once .
we will make america truly great again .
and thank you very much .
thank you everybody .
thank you .
thank you very much !
thank you , everybody .
great honor .
great honor , thank you .
this is a wonderful day .
on a saturday morning yet .
is n't that nice ?
thank you , all .
and we 're going to have an incredible convention .
it 's really going well .
we 're going to have an incredible convention .
and we 're going to get things solved , and we 're going to do _UNK_ of wonderful things for our country , most importantly .
so i 'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign , and the white house , to fix our _UNK_ system _UNK_ we are in a _UNK_ , _UNK_ system _UNK_ and to make america safe again and to make america great again .
i want to also address the islamic terror attack in france .
we 've witnessed horror beyond belief , no matter where you look .
and now it 's happening more and more .
and it 's never going to stop .
we need new leadership .
we need new thinking .
we need strength .
we need in our country law and order .
and if i 'm elected president , that will happen .
i want to express our unyielding support for the people of france , and we mourn their loss as a nation .
and as far as turkey is concerned , so many friends in turkey , great people , amazing people .
we wish them well .
it looks like they 're resolving the difficulty , but we wish them well .
a lot _UNK_ a lot of anguish last night , but hopefully it 'll all work out .
now , as , hopefully , the next president of the united states , i want to _UNK_ back to what 's happened over the years .
the middle east today is more unstable than ever before .
never been like this .
out of control .
after four years of clinton , who really led the way and led obama down a _UNK_ path , because i do n't even think he could have made these decisions so badly , she led him right down a _UNK_ path .
he did n't know what he was doing .
iraq , syria , all into chaos .
and iran is on a path to nuclear weapons .
and on top of that , we gave them back $ 150 billion , and we did n't get our _UNK_ until the end .
now we 're seeing _UNK_ in turkey , a further _UNK_ of the failures of _UNK_ .
you just have to look , every single thing they touched has turned to _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ problems .
we also need to bring back in this country _UNK_ because we see what happened _UNK_ our industry , our manufacturing , our jobs .
they 've been taken away , like we 're _UNK_ .
taken away .
and we 're going to bring them back .
i found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous _UNK_ really prosperous society for all americans .
indiana governor mike _UNK_ was my first choice .
i 've admired the work he 's done , especially in the state of indiana .
and i 'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute .
but i also admire the fact that he fights for the people , and he 's going to fight for you .
he is a solid , solid person .
governor _UNK_ served indiana with distinction in congress .
he rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire house republican conference .
number one .
he 's really got the skills of a highly talented executive , leading the state of indiana to jobs , growth , and opportunity , in _UNK_ of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state 's way by the obama administration .
it 's _UNK_ out there .
high taxes and regulations .
and it 's out of control .
mike _UNK_ is a man of honor , character , and honesty .
we know that .
hillary clinton is the _UNK_ of corruption .
she 's a corrupt person .
what she 's done with her e-mails , what she 's done with so many things , and i see the ads up all the time , the ads .
she 's _UNK_ bought and paid for by wall street , the special interests , the lobbyists , 100 percent .
she 's _UNK_ hillary .
and i think that , while she got away with murder , in fact , i think it might be her greatest _UNK_ , _UNK_ the recent _UNK_ , and her lies , and the loss of _UNK_ e-mails _UNK_ but it was n't a loss , she _UNK_ _UNK_ that in itself is a major crime .
other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they 've done , which is _UNK_ compared to what happened with hillary clinton .
_UNK_ thousand e-mails are missing , and that 's _UNK_ ?
did n't give them to the fbi ?
did n't give them to the attorney general , and that 's _UNK_ ?
_UNK_ her _UNK_ clean , that 's _UNK_ ?
these are crimes .
these are crimes .
and how she got away with it , i think i understand it , but i think a lot of people do n't .
but i do believe , while she did n't pay the price she should have paid , she 's going to pay that price when november 8th rolls around .
she 's going to pay it at the polls .
i believe that .
on top of everything else , hillary made $ _UNK_ million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time .
she 's _UNK_ owned by wall street .
we believe in _UNK_ ; she believes in _UNK_ .
and it 's not that she believes in it .
the people that give her all of this money believe in it .
and she 'll believe in whatever they want her to believe .
believe me .
that 's it .
what a difference between _UNK_ hillary clinton and mike _UNK_ .
mike _UNK_ will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy : radical islam .
radical islamic terrorism .
you saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window .
you heard what he was screaming out the window .
you saw it in san _UNK_ .
you saw it at the world trade center .
you saw it in _UNK_ .
how _UNK_ was that ?
you saw it in paris .
you see it all over .
and hillary is a weak person .
we are the law and order candidates , and we 're the law and order party .
we 're going to change things around .
there 's going to be respect again for law and order .
hillary clinton 's foreign policy helped launch isis .
you know , she 's talking _UNK_ i see the ads she puts on .
if i make one statement , which is fine , she 'll take that statement and put on a _UNK_ _UNK_ ad , because she 's got a lot of money because it 's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests .
got a lot of money .
but i see the ads on foreign policy .
she 's talking about donald trump does n't have foreign policy experience .
of course not .
i 've been a very , very , very successful _UNK_ .
i mean _UNK_ but _UNK_ but if you look at my calls , i said , do n't go into iraq .
nobody cared , because i was a _UNK_ .
i was a civilian .
take the oil .
many , many calls i 've made .
you take a look .
i said that in _UNK_ and in the _UNK_ , that was going to happen .
i was the one that predicted it .
and everybody said , he 's wrong , he 's wrong .
president obama said , if it happens , they 're going to get to the back of the line , which probably is one of the reasons they lost , because i consider it a win .
i think it was a win for them , actually , because they do n't want to be told what to do .
and they do n't want to be told that when people _UNK_ into the country , they have to take them even if they 're not qualified , even if they do n't have _UNK_ , even if they have no idea where they come from .
and i said that _UNK_ 's going to happen .
i said that they are going to break away .
and everybody _UNK_ at me .
and the odds were 20 percent .
and then when it happened , she took an ad saying , oh , donald trump said this or that , but i 'm the one that said it was going to happen .
and some of the more fair reporters _UNK_ about 30 percent of them _UNK_ said he was right .
i appreciate that .
_UNK_ percent did n't , so that 's _UNK_ so mike _UNK_ will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy .
so important .
now , i think if you look at one of the big reasons that i chose mike _UNK_ and one of the reasons is party unity , i have to be honest .
so many people have said party unity .
because i 'm an _UNK_ .
i want to be an _UNK_ .
i think it 's one of the reasons i won in _UNK_ .
i won in _UNK_ .
this was n't close .
this was n't close .
now , this was n't close .
this was _UNK_ in the history of the republican party , history , with 17 people running , you have to understand , other people ran against one , two , and three .
there were _UNK_ we got _UNK_ i say we , because i 'm the _UNK_ , i 'm a _UNK_ _UNK_ i 'm doing a good job , but i 'm a _UNK_ _UNK_ we got almost 14 million votes .
that 's more than any other person in the history of the republican party in the primary system running for president .
think of it .
that 's more than ronald reagan , who we love .
that 's more than richard nixon .
it 's more than dwight _UNK_ eisenhower .
you know , he won the second world war , in all fairness .
pretty good .
it 's more than the _UNK_ .
but i mean by a lot .
i do n't mean by a little .
but that 's with 17 people .
people do n't _UNK_ that .
that means our message is _UNK_ .
and i want to thank all of the loyal people _UNK_ because i have such loyal , _UNK_ people , and they _UNK_ that just yesterday in cleveland , where it 's going to be so amazing .
but they _UNK_ it .
it was on display , where we had this group of people , who _UNK_ many of whom i 've known , and i wo n't say , because for party unity , i 'll say they 're wonderful people , _UNK_ ?
never trump , they said , never trump , never trump .
oh , we 're going to win .
they got _UNK_ .
and they got _UNK_ immediately , because people want what we 're saying to happen .
they 're tired of a country that has _UNK_ trade deals , that has no borders , that has taxes that are through the roof , highest _UNK_ nation just about in the world , that has regulations that do n't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start _UNK_ and , by the way , speaking of destroying businesses , we 're going to take care of the miners and we 're going to take care of the _UNK_ .
we 're going to put them back to work .
so they 're very tired of it .
but i want to thank all of those people that _UNK_ delegates that were on the different committees , because , boy , was that something .
did we show them something .
and unfortunately , the vote was very late .
but essentially , we had _UNK_ _UNK_ this was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we 're going to have a big fight .
we 're not going to have a fight .
people agree with what we 've _UNK_ they want the wall .
they want the borders .
they want these things to happen .
and what we 're doing ... and what we 're doing that i 'm so proud of , so proud _UNK_ and nobody else would even think about doing it _UNK_ i fought very hard for it .
we 'll call it the johnson amendment , where he took away from the _UNK_ _UNK_ and i want to thank the _UNK_ , because without the _UNK_ , i could not have won this nomination .
the _UNK_ have been _UNK_ .
i dominated with the _UNK_ .
a lot of people were surprised .
they say he 's not perfect .
but you know what ?
they know i 'm going to get the job done , and they 're really smart .
and i said _UNK_ and i said for the _UNK_ , that we 're going to do something that nobody 's even tried to do .
you have the johnson amendment passed by lyndon johnson and his group .
and he was a powerful president .
he knew how to get things done .
he got _UNK_ down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him .
but he was a powerful president .
and we call it the johnson amendment , where you are just absolutely _UNK_ if you 're _UNK_ , if you want to talk religion , you lose your _UNK_ status .
we put into the platform , we 're going to get rid of that _UNK_ johnson amendment .
and we 're going to let _UNK_ , we 're going to let christians and jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk .
i saw this .
i had so many great leaders so many times up to my office , the top _UNK_ the absolute top _UNK_ leaders , christian leaders , jewish leaders , believe it or not , some muslim leaders _UNK_ people are going to be surprised to hear that _UNK_ i had the top leaders up to my office , and i said , why is it that you 're so powerful as an individual , and yet when you get out there , you 're sort of _UNK_ ?
and they did n't know how to answer the question .
and it took two , three meetings before i figured it out .
one great , great _UNK_ that everybody knows , but whose name i will not reveal , said , mr. trump , we live in fear in our churches and our _UNK_ .
we live in fear that we 're going to lose our _UNK_ status if we say anything that 's even slightly political .
and i looked out the window .
i was in trump tower , and i pointed to people walking down the street .
i said , well , they have the right to speak , but you do n't .
that means they 're more powerful than you are .
we have to do something about it .
how did it start ?
how did it start ?
and they said , it started because of lyndon johnson .
and he actually had a problem in texas with a certain religious leader .
and he did this , and he got it done .
and we 're going to _UNK_ it , so that religious leaders in this country , and those _UNK_ people , and not because they backed me in such large numbers , but so that religion can again have a voice , because religion 's voice has been taken away .
and we 're going to change that .
_UNK_ ?
all right .
back to mike _UNK_ .
so one of the primary reasons i chose mike was i looked at indiana , and i won indiana big .
remember , indiana was going to be the _UNK_ .
that 's where trump was going to _UNK_ they agreed i 'd win new york , i 'd win pennsylvania , i 'd win all these places .
but indiana was going to be the _UNK_ .
so i got to study indiana , and i got to study new york and a lot of other places , and i saw how _UNK_ , signed by bill clinton , has _UNK_ our manufacturing jobs , just _UNK_ us like we 've never been _UNK_ before .
_UNK_ , again , signed by bill clinton .
_UNK_ is the worst economic deal in the history of our country .
manufacturing down in some states 55 percent , 60 percent .
it 's a horror show , moving to mexico , moving to other places .
i have a friend who 's a great _UNK_ .
what he builds is plants .
that 's all he does , is build plants .
he does n't build buildings .
he does n't _UNK_ he builds plants .
it 's the biggest in the world , from what i hear .
i said , how 's business ?
i was with him the other day .
how 's business ?
he goes _UNK_ .
i said , really , _UNK_ , i 'm surprised .
why is it _UNK_ ?
because i think of him as building in this country .
he says , donald , what we 're doing in mexico , you wo n't believe .
i said , what do you mean ?
he said , we 're building plants in mexico the likes of which we 've never seen .
i said , what about this country ?
not much .
not much .
that 's the expression .
he said exactly that .
not much .
i said , but mexico ?
he said , you 've never seen anything like it .
it 's incredible .
folks , that 's going to stop .
we 're going to go reverse it .
we 're going to bring our jobs back to this country .
we ca n't be the _UNK_ people anymore .
_UNK_ ?
and he was better than a _UNK_ .
he 's better than a _UNK_ .
i would say , how are we doing ?
and you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars .
does n't cost me millions .
me , i give them $ 10,000 , _UNK_ ?
it costs other people millions .
it costs other campaigns millions to get a report .
every time they get a report , it 's millions .
but i 'll tell you what , a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report .
and he said it .
he did n't say it from the _UNK_ of he 's _UNK_ about it .
just fact .
how are we doing ?
_UNK_ in mexico .
in fact , he actually said , i 've never , ever seen anything like it .
and if you look , ford is building massive plants there instead of michigan .
we want them to build them in michigan .
they 're going to build them in michigan .
and you know that i know how to do that .
so easy .
so easy .
but they 're not going to do and they 're not going to take advantage of us without _UNK_ .
there are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you 're going to you 're your product and sell it in here .
there are consequences .
and those consequences are going to keep companies in our country .
it 's very simple .
and everybody here knows what the consequences are , but i wo n't say that because i 'm much more interested right now in mike .
indiana 's unemployment rate _UNK_ and this is the primary reason i wanted mike , other than he looks very good , other than he 's got an incredible family , incredible wife and family _UNK_ _UNK_ is amazing .
incredible family .
highly respected .
expected to go for another four years .
he would have won , i think , very easily in indiana .
indiana , their unemployment rate has fallen , when he was there , when he started , _UNK_ percent when he was governor , when he took over , to less than 5 percent in may of _UNK_ since january 2013 , indiana 's labor force has increased by more than _UNK_ jobs .
you have to understand , i 've gone around to all these states .
i 've gone to all of them .
and every time , i have _UNK_ .
i say give me the _UNK_ on a state .
and it 's always bad , down , down , down .
down 40 percent , 50 percent , 60 percent in some cases .
here 's somebody where it 's gone up .
private sector job growth is up by more than _UNK_ jobs since _UNK_ that 's like very _UNK_ .
governor _UNK_ balanced the budget .
can you imagine a balanced budget ?
our budget 's so out of _UNK_ in this country , we do n't know what we 're doing .
we 're going to owe very soon $ _UNK_ trillion .
he balanced the budget .
they do n't know what that means .
governor _UNK_ balanced the budget , produced a surplus , and _UNK_ a $ 2 billion reserve fund in the state of indiana .
it 's also _UNK_ _UNK_ , their bonds are _UNK_ _UNK_ .
very few states have that .
_UNK_ .
the best .
that 's as good as you can get , whether you 're a company , a state , _UNK_ .
indiana was recently recognized by chief executive magazine as the _UNK_ state in the _UNK_ for business .
number one .
and it 's not even close .
there are _UNK_ _UNK_ fewer _UNK_ on unemployment insurance now than there were when mike _UNK_ took office .
so you have fewer _UNK_ , fewer people from indiana .
and _UNK_ that , bobby _UNK_ , my friend , who really did help me .
i mean , if you want a _UNK_ , bobby _UNK_ in indiana , we love bobby _UNK_ .
but he agrees with everything i 'm saying .
he loves the governor .
indiana has the _UNK_ unemployment rate in the nation , for veterans , where nobody 's fighting for the veterans like i 'm fighting for the veterans , the veterans have been left behind .
if you remember a few months ago , hillary clinton said really _UNK_ they 're doing much better , the _UNK_ .
is much better .
they 're doing a much better job than people give it credit for .
people are dying on line waiting for five , six days for doctors .
people are dying on _UNK_ they ca n't even see a doctor .
it 's a _UNK_ .
take a look at what 's happening with the _UNK_ .
in arizona .
take a look at what 's happening with _UNK_ you know , just the veterans administration hospitals .
it 's a _UNK_ .
it 's corrupt .
it 's _UNK_ .
it 's a _UNK_ .
and hillary clinton thought it was just fine .
and , boy , am i going to win big with the veterans .
i mean , we know that for a fact .
so it 's now _UNK_ percent for veterans .
in 2013 , when mike _UNK_ took office , the rate for veterans was _UNK_ percent .
it was _UNK_ in the nation , one of the bad ones , and now it 's almost the best .
got them jobs .
got them jobs .
_UNK_ is _UNK_ second in top 10 _UNK_ areas for young college graduates .
that 's a great thing .
they 're going to stay there .
that 's a great thing .
and mike worked hard on that .
he was telling me , that was not easy .
under governor _UNK_ 's leadership , indiana enacted the largest _UNK_ 12 education funding increase in the state 's history .
so you 're balancing budgets , and yet you 're giving more money to education .
is n't that a great thing ?
indiana has just about the largest school choice program in america .
school choice is where it 's at , folks .
you want to get your schools better , you better get rid of common core fast .
governor _UNK_ enacted the largest income tax cut in the state 's history .
think of that .
we 're cutting taxes and balancing budgets .
and along with corporate tax reform , just about number one in the country .
_UNK_ _UNK_ indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure .
so with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets , we 're spending more money on education , and the infrastructure is kept up .
that had so much _UNK_ look , as a _UNK_ , nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as donald trump .
i build infrastructure .
do i know how to build a wall ?
do i know how to build infrastructure ?
you know , it 's very interesting .
we 're building _UNK_ we 're building _UNK_ i won the _UNK_ which is pretty amazing with the obama administration , but i won the right to have the old post office building on pennsylvania avenue , right near the white house , and it 's an amazing _UNK_ probably the best _UNK_ , one of the most sought after projects in the history of the _UNK_ , general services .
and i really like what 's happened .
we 're going to have an opening very soon .
_UNK_ and eric and _UNK_ did a _UNK_ job on it .
but i thought the other day , i was going over the numbers , we 're under budget and about a year _UNK_ actually more than a year _UNK_ we 're a year ahead of schedule , and we 're under budget substantially .
and the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do .
and when i explained to a government representative that we 're under budget and ahead of schedule , they almost fell off , because they 've never heard those words before .
they 've never heard them .
so when i see what happened to indiana , which was having tremendous problems , when i see what happened to indiana under mike 's work _UNK_ also his predecessor did a great job , by the way , great job , who 's now at _UNK_ _UNK_ who 's now at _UNK_ _UNK_ when i see what happened with respect to the numbers , the state , and everything else , that , to me , was probably the single most important point , because it 's something that has n't happened _UNK_ almost has not happened in this whole country .
the _UNK_ and the strength of indiana has been incredible , and i learned that when i campaigned there .
and i learned that when i won that state in a _UNK_ .
and i learned that when governor _UNK_ , under tremendous pressure from _UNK_ people , _UNK_ somebody else , but it was more of an _UNK_ for me , if you remember .
he talked about trump , then he talked about ted _UNK_ who 's a good guy , by the way , who 's going to be speaking at the convention , ted cruz , good guy _UNK_ but he talked about trump , ted , then he went back to trump .
i said , who did he _UNK_ ?
so even though he was under pressure , because i 'm so , you know , outside of the _UNK_ , it was the single greatest _UNK_ _UNK_ i 've ever had in my life , _UNK_ ?
i will tell you .
so with that , i would like to introduce a man who i truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the united states , governor mike _UNK_ .
thank you .
thank you , everybody .
thank you .
_UNK_ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ !
[ cheering ] _UNK_ !
that 's a lot of people .
that 's a lot of people .
thank you , everybody .
thank you .
all right .
let 's turn that music down .
we want to get to business , right ?
get to business .
how is your governor doing , by the way ?
good ?
i think so .
i think so .
i just want to thank all of the people of indiana .
you know , we had a great victory here not so long ago .
and indiana was the state that put me over the top .
thank you , folks .
thank you .
[ cheering ] well , we have a lot of things to discuss , but we had some very bad news a few days ago , and you saw what happened .
a lot of bad things are happening .
and i was going to go through a whole _UNK_ of that , but we do n't want to .
we want to be _UNK_ .
we want to be positive .
we want to be strong .
and we 're going to be strong .
we 're going to be stronger than ever before .
we 're going to be greater than ever before .
we 're going to bring our jobs back .
we 're going bring our military back .
it 's being _UNK_ so badly .
we 're going to take care of our veterans , which we have to take care of .
we 're going to get rid of obamacare , which is a disaster .
[ cheering ] and replace it with something terrific .
we end common core .
we bring our education back to the local communities like this local community where the people love their children and they want to see their children be well educated .
it 's so important .
we 're going to save our second amendment .
we 're going to save our second amendment .
and it 's under siege .
you know , i wrote a few words today .
and i think it 's important that we go through it as a group .
it 's been a special place and you 're special people .
and i know so many people tonight in the audience .
and you 're all over .
look at all those cameras up there , folks .
look at all those cameras .
they do n't stop .
they do n't stop .
but i just wanted to say i wrote this quickly , but it means it came right from the heart .
and i have to say that our whole nation _UNK_ and _UNK_ for the loss of five _UNK_ in dallas , law enforcement .
these were great , great people .
great people .
[ applause ] we pray for their families .
we pray for their loved ones .
we pray for all the wounded survivors .
we pray for our country .
it 's so important .
the police are not just part of our society .
our police are the best of our society .
remember that .
we have to remember that .
they represent our highest ideals , our greatest values , and our most noble _UNK_ .
when our police are attacked , our entire nation is attacked .
remember that .
remember that .
so the message must be delivered clearly for all to hear , the hostility against our police has to end , and it has to end right now .
and we have to say together , and we have to be strong .
we have to take care of everyone .
the two people that were killed in louisiana and minnesota , it was tough .
it was tough to watch for everybody here it was tough to watch .
we have to figure it out .
we have to figure out what is going on .
was it training ?
was it something else ?
it could have been something else .
we have to take care of everybody .
remember that .
but we have to also -- we have to get to the bottom of things .
we have to .
but we can never , ever forget the hundreds of thousands of great deals and great things that our police all over the country do , and nobody recognizes them for what they do .
and when there is a problem , as bad as these two situations were , and i personally think they were , they were bad .
i hated , i hated watching it .
but as bad as they were , they get _UNK_ all over the world for days and days , and all of the good things which are _UNK_ thousands of times , nobody talks about .
so we have to remember , we have to cherish and take care of our police .
if we do n't , if we do n't , we do n't have a country anymore .
we have a country in chaos .
and remember this .
and i say it once , and i say it with love , and i say it with compassion .
because i have love for our country , and i have great compassion for our people in our country .
but i am the law and order candidate .
we need law and order , and we need strength in this country .
we do n't have strength in our country .
we have _UNK_ hillary clinton , as _UNK_ as you get .
i mean , you saw that with the e-mails .
it 's a _UNK_ system , folks .
it 's a _UNK_ system .
just remember it .
it 's a _UNK_ system .
it 's _UNK_ in so many different ways .
we 're going to _UNK_ it out .
you ca n't even watch what happens .
we had a young man who did nothing by comparison to what she did , and he warned his friends of a problem that was coming _UNK_ .
and they came down on him with a _UNK_ .
and they let her go .
_UNK_ missing e-mails .
they let her go .
lies all over the place .
and they let her go .
think of it .
it 's a _UNK_ .
so we 're going to get on to other _UNK_ .
but i have to say law enforcement has to remain with us .
we have to take care of our police and our law enforcement officials .
we 're going to do it .
we 're going to continue to do it .
we 're going remember that they do a _UNK_ job .
we 're going to remember that they do a great job .
and every once in a while , problems will happen .
and we 're going take care of those problems .
and they can be bad problems .
but we are going to treat our police with respect .
remember that .
okay ?
now i 'm looking at different rates and different crimes .
and you see the crime rate in large _UNK_ of our country is going way up .
you look at certain inner cities , and look at chicago .
look at what is going on .
since president obama became president , almost 5,000 killings in chicago .
and nobody talks about it .
well , we 're going to start talking about it .
because we have to make this a safe country .
and , you know , i would say two weeks ago , a month ago , i would n't be saying these words .
i was talking about the border .
i was talking about the wall .
and we will build the wall .
that i can tell you .
i can tell you .
we 're going to build it .
do n't worry about it .
are you ready ?
who is going to pay for the wall ?
i do n't hear you .
who is going to pay for the wall ?
and they will .
very much .
they will .
100 % .
and you know what ?
they 'll be happy to pay for the wall .
we have a trade deficit with mexico that you would n't believe .
billions and billions and billions of dollars a year .
we 're losing on the border .
we 're losing on trade .
and when i was in the debates and i mentioned this , people would come up that i was debating against , and they used to say donald , you 're not really going to build a wall , are you ?
i say absolutely .
they say but you ca n't build a wall .
but i 'm in the construction .
you know how easy a wall is ?
a wall .
we build _UNK_ buildings with _UNK_ .
that 's tough construction , not a wall .
walls do n't have _UNK_ .
and _UNK_ are always tough .
but we 're going to have a very big beautiful gate in that wall , big and beautiful .
and that gate is going to be open .
and it 's going to be wide open for people to come into our country , but they 're going to come into our country legally .
they 're going to come in legally .
and there are going to be people that love our country .
they 're not going to be people that hate our country .
they 're not going to be people that we do n't know where they come from .
they 're not going to be people that come from the _UNK_ that do n't have _UNK_ , that do n't have _UNK_ , that we have no idea where they 're from .
we have no idea what their _UNK_ are .
we 're going to say no .
sorry .
no .
and we 'll help .
and in syria , we 'll build safe _UNK_ , and we 'll get other people to put up the money , because we 're going to owe very soon 20 trillion , trillion with a t. nobody even knows what it means .
we 're going to owe -- right now , can you believe this ?
$ 20 trillion .
soon going to $ _UNK_ trillion .
so we 're going get the gulf states who have so much money , folks .
so much money .
and we 're going to get them to put up the money and others .
and we 're going to take care of people .
and we 're going have compassion .
but we ca n't allow them to come into our country .
we have enough problems right now .
you see what happened in _UNK_ .
you see what happened in san _UNK_ .
we ca n't allow it to happen .
so we 're going to build safe _UNK_ .
we 're going take care of people .
we 're going to have other people fund these safe _UNK_ .
we 're going to build up our military .
we should have never been in iraq .
but once we went into iraq , we should have never left the way we left .
we left like _UNK_ .
we went in , should have never happened .
i did n't want to go from the beginning , and i have proof from the beginning .
i did n't want iraq .
i said you 're going to _UNK_ the entire middle east , and that 's exactly what happened .
but then we were there .
losing thousands of lives , spending trillions and trillions of dollars .
probably in the middle east we 're up to $ 4 trillion .
and we 're in worse shape now than we were 15 years ago before the whole deal started .
far worse .
not even close .
far worse .
far worse .
so what we 're going to do is we 're going to start thinking smart .
we 're going to be smart again .
we 're going to make great military , and by the way , i said for years we 've got to keep the oil .
i said keep the oil .
you leave , you keep the oil .
we did n't do it .
we did n't do it .
i said it for years .
once we were in , i said when we get out , it 's going to be a disaster , but when we get out , we should have left some troops there .
and i hate saying that .
but we should have left some troops there , and it would have been better , certainly , than it is right now .
ca n't be any worse .
but i always said keep the oil .
but we did n't keep the oil .
so who has the oil right now ?
a lot of the oil is had by isis .
and we created isis .
and hillary clinton through her _UNK_ directly and _UNK_ created isis .
and now she wants to get rid of it .
she says yes , we will fight isis .
she is the one that created it with _UNK_ , with _UNK_ , _UNK_ policy .
policy that 's only going to get worse .
she is the one that created it .
and that 's what 's happened .
and so now we have problems all over the place .
we have our cities _UNK_ .
we have isis looking at us .
and by the way , when our enemies all over the world , including our friends all over the world look at what 's happening to our country , where the other night you had 11 , think of it , 11 cities potentially in a _UNK_ stage .
marches all over the united states , and tough marches , anger , hatred , hatred .
started by a _UNK_ that some people asked for a moment of silence for him .
for the _UNK_ , for the _UNK_ .
okay ?
so when our enemies look at what is going on with our country , they see our deficits .
they see we do n't win anymore .
we do n't win .
we do n't win .
we do n't win at anything .
i always say when i was going , when i was young going to high school and going to college and before that we never lost .
you know , united states , they said had never lost a war .
now we never win .
we do n't win on trade .
we do n't win with our military .
our military is so _UNK_ , our military has fighter _UNK_ that are in use _UNK_ by great , great american people that are so old , and they ca n't get parts for the fighter _UNK_ .
these are people flying these _UNK_ now in combat .
they ca n't get parts .
so they go to the plane _UNK_ in the deserts .
they go to _UNK_ where they have similar planes , and they _UNK_ apart to use for our fighter pilots to fly .
this is what we 've been reduced to .
and i 'll tell you something .
hillary clinton is _UNK_ , okay .
the greatest single thing in my opinion that she 's ever done is to get out of the _UNK_ problem .
i think it is incredible .
she did a great job on that .
i think it is her greatest achievement .
i think when they look back on hillary clinton , they will say the greatest achievement of hillary clinton was getting out of this problem with _UNK_ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ could n't have gotten out .
she was so _UNK_ .
i have a list .
look .
page after page of the lies -- page after page of the lies .
all over .
look at this .
page , page .
look , i do n't want to read it to you .
the press would say , you should spend your entire speech talking about hillary clinton and the e-mails .
i do n't want to talk about it .
you know what , it was all lies , folks .
i do n't have to go through and bore everybody .
it was so _UNK_ .
it was so _UNK_ .
it was so outrageous .
you look at general petraeus and look at what happened to him for a tiny fraction of what _UNK_ hillary did .
you look at other people , for a tiny fraction , look at what happened to them .
so i just tell you this , we have a candidate on the other side who , if she ever gets elected , it will be four more _UNK_ years of obama , it will be four more years of weakness , it will be four more years of civil _UNK_ .
it will be four more years of not winning with our military and not winning against isis .
they do n't have a _UNK_ how to beat isis .
they do n't have a _UNK_ .
but it will be four more years of obama , and obama care and all of these things that do n't work .
except i think actually it will be worse .
today i see _UNK_ _UNK_ gave her this very you know , sort of strange _UNK_ .
i want to tell you , a lot of _UNK_ _UNK_ people are so _UNK_ about it , they are going to be voting for trump .
i really believe that .
they 're going to be voting for trump .
they are going to be voting for trump .
because the one thing that _UNK_ _UNK_ and i have in common was trade .
now he ca n't do anything about it .
he just knew it was bad .
i know how to fix it .
because i am in favor of free trade .
a lot of people say i 'm an _UNK_ , when you lose $ _UNK_ billion a year on trade deficits , maybe that is not the worse thing .
but we 'll straight it out .
i believe in open borders for trade and free trade .
the problem we have is that virtually every single country that deals with us are far _UNK_ and far better .
they have their best negotiators .
we have people that are political _UNK_ negotiating for us and people that do n't know what they 're doing .
i have the greatest businessmen in the world that have _UNK_ me , including people like carl _UNK_ , great _UNK_ .
we have some of the greatest negotiators , maybe the greatest in the world and we do n't use them .
we use political _UNK_ .
we have people in there that got in for politics .
you could look at the biggest companies in the world , and it is small _UNK_ .
it is _UNK_ compared to some of the massive trade deals .
and we have people that should never be negotiating trade deals .
just like we have secretary of state kerry negotiating with iran , and what they did to him and you because he has no idea what the hell he was doing and what he gave away , israel is in serious jeopardy , frankly we 're in serious jeopardy , and we made a power out of iran .
we made a power .
number one , we should have never gone in and negotiated that deal until we got our _UNK_ back .
ever .
ever .
we should have never , ever gone in .
and what you say is , folks , we have to get them back .
and if you do n't want to give them back , you leave the meeting .
you leave the meeting .
and you double up your sanctions , you would have had them back within 24 hours , i guarantee you that .
but we _UNK_ n't do that .
i kept waiting for the whole delegation , i kept waiting for them to leave , to get up and leave .
i used to say get up and leave .
perfect .
get up .
we did n't win anything .
the only time that kerry left was at _UNK_ years old to go into a _UNK_ _UNK_ where he fell and broke his leg , right .
and i always tell people , i promise you i will never enter a _UNK_ race when i 'm in the midst of an important nuclear negotiation , i promise .
i promise .
but when you look at it , number one , we should have gotten them back .
and the other thing , we should have never given them back the $ 150 billion .
and i would have said very _UNK_ , my father used to think i was a little bit rough , and he used to go , easy , son .
son , take it nice and easy .
you have to take the _UNK_ out .
he had an expression .
good father .
we all have great fathers , i hope .
i had a good father .
but i learned a lot .
he said , and he would go like this the _UNK_ out .
take the _UNK_ .
easy .
nice and easy .
take the _UNK_ out .
you 're a little too rough .
what do you mean , _UNK_ ?
you 're a little too rough .
and over the years , i think i learned that .
made great deals and built a great company .
great company .
took advantage of every single thing you can because you are working for yourself and families and your employees and took advantage of the laws , some of the laws are the _UNK_ laws i 've ever seen and so _UNK_ but you take advantage of them .
you 're like a business person , right , got to take advantage of them .
because you are really _UNK_ your employees , your company and your family .
but my father would say take the _UNK_ out .
so here is what i would have said on the _UNK_ in the old days when i 'm young , i would say we 're not paying you back the 150 billion , you 're not getting it .
and there could be a lot of hard feeling in the room .
take a while -- they will still come back , do n't worry about it .
because they need us .
they need us .
and then i would have left and here go the sanctions .
i would have done two things .
number one , _UNK_ before we _UNK_ the first word .
and number two -- and how long were the _UNK_ there .
that negotiation took forever and we did n't win a point .
we lost everything .
they 're going to be a nuclear power and they are rich and powerful .
how about yemen .
they are fighting on the other side of yemen .
and they 're fighting and _UNK_ fighting .
why did n't they make the deal to get out of yemen and kerry said because he did n't want to come _UNK_ _UNK_ -- _UNK_ the negotiations .
they do n't want to bring something else to _UNK_ it .
these are _UNK_ .
but my father would say take the _UNK_ out .
so here is what i would say .
we would n't be negotiating because our prisoners would have been back years ago .
i would have said , look , _UNK_ , here is the story .
we have a problem .
our country is _UNK_ broke .
we owe 19 trillion and going to be 20 trillion or $ _UNK_ trillion with the _UNK_ very soon .
i want to give you the money back , i really do .
we do n't have it , i 'm sorry .
they would have gone _UNK_ .
they would have said , what do you mean you have to give us -- no , no , we want to .
we do n't have it .
i want to so badly .
we love you .
you 're such great people .
such nice people .
so kind .
take a look at what they do to their hostage and prisoners and you 'll find out about tough people .
great negotiators .
_UNK_ , great negotiators .
i would have said , remember , nice and easy .
i would have rather done it my way , but i respected my father .
so i would have said , we do n't have the money , ca n't do it .
they would have left and we would have left and we would have been back in two weeks .
we would have saved $ 150 billion .
so those two things .
we would have had our _UNK_ back and saved $ 150 billion .
now they are so rich , they are buying _UNK_ , they are buying everything .
they are buying probably nuclear weapons , we just do n't know about it , okay .
what the hell -- do you have to -- nuclear weapons , we 're worried about them making nuclear weapons .
they 'll buy them .
they have the money .
they made such _UNK_ out of us .
folks , those days are over .
they 're over .
they 're over .
i call obama the _UNK_ president .
so we have a _UNK_ named sergeant _UNK_ .
so sergeant _UNK_ thinks he likes their way of life , obviously .
oh , they have a wonderful way of life .
so one day he leaves .
we lose five and maybe six , but five at least people looking for him .
they were killed .
they were killed by the enemy .
they go out there looking for him .
they knew he left .
everybody with him knew he left because he was all _UNK_ out and a _UNK_ in them , not us .
so they knew he left .
so knowing that , the fact they have a _UNK_ and i believe a general talking to the people that knew him , and they told the _UNK_ and the general that he left .
he _UNK_ .
remember the old day , a _UNK_ , what happened ?
_UNK_ .
20 years ago , it was _UNK_ , but slowly .
ten years ago it was long prison .
today they are probably talking about nothing .
that is where we 've come .
but i call him the _UNK_ .
so we get _UNK_ , right , a _UNK_ .
and they get five of the most vicious killers that they have , that they 've been after for nine years to get them out and they bring them and they are back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody , including us .
this stuff has got to stop , folks .
and _UNK_ , we 're not closing _UNK_ .
we 're going to fill it up .
we 're not closing _UNK_ .
we 're not closing _UNK_ .
and i see hillary clinton said , i do not like donald trump 's _UNK_ .
look , here is the story .
i think i have a great _UNK_ .
she uses the word _UNK_ but i love when she uses the word _UNK_ .
they are _UNK_ heads off of christians and everybody else .
we have n't seen that since _UNK_ times .
you read the history books , they _UNK_ off heads .
well , they are _UNK_ off heads .
they are drowning people in steel _UNK_ , by the dozens , at a time .
and she says , we do n't like his _UNK_ .
let me tell you , folks , it is time for a tough _UNK_ .
we 've had enough .
we 've had enough .
we 've had enough .
we 've had enough .
so we 're going to do things the smart way .
i remember during the debate they asked one of the folks on the _UNK_ stage who is becoming _UNK_ and _UNK_ by the day with me , which some of the people are recovering .
it was -- i 'll tell you what .
they say it was the _UNK_ primary that anybody has seen .
they say the _UNK_ in recorded history .
who knew what went on before recorded .
but it was pretty _UNK_ .
and some of the folks , i saw one yesterday , i will not even mention names because i want to be friends with everybody , right .
i want to be friends with them .
except for the real enemy .
but they 'll sign a document , all right , it is called a pledge .
i pledge -- i pledge , i _UNK_ , i pledge that if i do n't make it , i 'm going to support the nominee of the party .
it does n't say , subject to change , subject to the weather , subject to the sun does n't come up .
no .
it said , i pledge .
and for that pledge , they got access to millions of dollars worth of material from the republican national committee , the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , doing a great job .
and if he does n't , i 'll tell you .
and if he does n't over the next four or five weeks , i 'll tell you .
but they got access .
so they signed a pledge they will support .
i do n't want their support .
it wo n't mean one vote than perhaps their family .
it does n't mean anything .
but i signed the pledge , too .
and everybody wanted to sign the pledge .
and the reason they signed the pledge was to get me to sign it .
i signed it .
i would have honored it .
i said people should honor _UNK_ .
people should honor documents when they sign them .
you know , not a big deal .
not a big deal .
but they should honor them .
so here is the story , folks .
we 're losing our country .
we 're like a piece of _UNK_ _UNK_ at the borders .
that is going to end .
that 's going to end .
you know , the border patrol agents , _UNK_ , first time in history they 've done this , they 've never done this before , _UNK_ border patrol agents have _UNK_ donald trump .
they know better than anybody what is going on at the border .
and by the way , if and when we win , it is we -- i 'm just a _UNK_ folks , i 'm telling a message of common strength but i 'm just your _UNK_ and i 'm doing a good job as a _UNK_ , in all fairness , but _UNK_ border patrol agents _UNK_ donald trump and what they do now is stand there with beautiful equipment , great people , people walk right by them .
that is an easy job .
they ca n't stand it .
because they do n't like what is coming into our country .
they want to do their job .
with me , they 're going to be working really hard .
and i said to them , when they called me to tell me about the _UNK_ , never done it before , they 've never _UNK_ a presidential candidate before , _UNK_ , great , great people and i said to them , so let me tell you , i want to ask you this question -- how important is the wall ?
they said , mr. trump , the wall is vital .
i do n't know what i would have done if they said it is not important .
i would have said , i guess we 're not building it because i respect these people , they know better than anybody .
they know a hell of a lot of better than _UNK_ and people making a millions of dollars that do n't have a _UNK_ .
who is better at that ?
i said how important is the wall ?
mr. trump , never forget the answer , the wall is vital .
it is vital .
very important .
very important .
they actually said it is a tool toward real security , an important tool .
and then i spoke with _UNK_ joe _UNK_ from arizona and he called me out of the blue and i 've read about _UNK_ joe , i mean , he knows borders , right .
amazing guy .
tough guy .
but he 's an amazing guy .
and he said , mr. trump , i just want to you know that i 'm _UNK_ you because you know more about this stuff than anybody , you know more about this stuff than people doing it for 25 years .
you get it .
you know what is happening .
i 'm _UNK_ you .
and he 's actually a quality person .
he 's a tough guy .
but he 's a quality person .
he gets the job done .
amazing .
so i know about that .
and when it was coming time for the wall , i 'll never forget , _UNK_ fox , on one of the major networks , used the _UNK_ .
remember and i told this story a couple of times .
he said , we will not pay for the _UNK_ wall .
and i said , oh , he 's dead .
can you imagine , headlines tomorrow .
he used it on live television .
and i said , oh , i feel so badly for the guy .
and now in one way i was happy .
because he used to say , we 'll never build the wall .
now he 's saying we 'll never pay for the wall .
so we made progress .
add least he 's now _UNK_ it is going to get built , right .
and he seems like a nice guy but he got a little bit rough .
we will never pay for the -- _UNK_ -- wall .
i said oh , the poor guy he is going to get killed in the papers .
nobody mentioned it .
can you imagine if i threw out the _UNK_ .
i think it will be the electric chair , right .
would it be the electric chair .
and the press , i will tell you -- the people back there , and i will tell you this , not all of them , but many of them are the most _UNK_ human beings on the earth .
they are the most _UNK_ human beings on earth .
i 've had days that are so good , and then you wake up the next morning and you say , man , did they take that .
i wo n't even say what things -- i could go one after another .
and we do n't make a lot of mistakes , all of us , we do n't make mistakes but what they do is take a sentence and make it much different than what you said , much different from what you meant .
and all of a sudden , they 'll say , donald trump had a bad week because he said something perfect .
perfect .
okay .
perfect .
i 'm telling you , folks , and i tell it all of the time , because as a republican , and as a republican conservative , we are at a tremendous disadvantage .
you look at the way they treat _UNK_ hillary , you take a look at this compared to the way they treat other people , or the way they treat me , they are some of the worst human beings on earth .
i really mean it .
i really mean it .
you know , where are my protests .
i want some protesters .
you know , look at this room .
the governor just said he 's never seen a room like this in indiana with this many people .
he 's never seen anything like it .
look at this thing .
this is where your football team -- look at the _UNK_ .
everything is night .
i always talk about the wall is going to be really high , but that is really high up there .
that is a big one .
but you do n't see crowds like this .
we have crowds like this everywhere , no matter where we go .
and every time i go home and my wife says how was the crowd .
and i always say , did n't you see it ?
they keep those cameras on my face , they never take the cameras off my face because they do n't want people -- i wish they would turn the cameras over here .
take a look at this crowd .
take a look at this crowd .
look , the cameras are n't moving .
they are really _UNK_ .
i really mean this .
they are so _UNK_ .
that is why i love my protesters .
because the only time they move the cameras are when we have a protest .
if somebody were up there screaming or _UNK_ , the cameras , which i used to think were in a fixed position , i said maybe _UNK_ they ca n't move , but when we have a _UNK_ , they turn and -- they are like a _UNK_ all over the place .
through the _UNK_ 's _UNK_ , up around his _UNK_ .
you never saw cameras move like this .
the fact is that you have to know what you 're getting .
and the system is wonderful in many ways , but really bad in others .
and one of the worst aspects of our system is the _UNK_ press .
the _UNK_ media is one of the worst things .
i really mean it .
they write and say things that are _UNK_ .
so -- and i like to say , you know what , when people see or read or hear things , they 'll say , i 'll tell you what -- one of the most incredible -- people say what have you learned ?
i said , you know what i 've learned is how smart the people are .
because their rating is so low , they are so -- thought of so badly , it is like how smart the people were .
and i 'll say this .
various _UNK_ , some of whom truly _UNK_ donald trump have said what has happened to us -- to us , i 'm the _UNK_ , you 're the important ones in this whole thing , but what happened to us is one of the greatest political _UNK_ they 've ever seen in the history of the country .
i did n't even know that .
i did n't even know that .
bill _UNK_ , of course i 'm on his show tonight so if you get home you will see the second _UNK_ .
but bill _UNK_ said , the single greatest political _UNK_ that he 's seen in his lifetime .
now he 's a _UNK_ .
a smart guy and tough .
tough .
but the single greatest political _UNK_ that he 's seen in his lifetime is donald trump and all of us , the whole thing .
we 've been on the cover -- we 've been on the cover of `` time '' magazine , so much that it becomes routine .
in fact , they just told me , mr. trump , sir , you 're on the cover of `` time '' magazine again this week .
i said all right .
in the old days , i would say that is a big deal .
and now it is like , really , that is good , that is all right .
you 're on the cover of time magazine .
i 'm not on the cover of time magazine .
you 're on the cover .
just remember that .
so we have a lot of things that are taking place .
we have a _UNK_ _UNK_ , we have an enemy that is _UNK_ and a press that is _UNK_ .
we have a group of people that want to get elected who have a _UNK_ system and who have really _UNK_ the system to a large extent .
they 've really _UNK_ the system .
say what you want about _UNK_ _UNK_ , but the _UNK_ , that was worse than what happened with us .
and frankly , the only reason i could win is we won in such _UNK_ all over the place , including in indiana .
what a _UNK_ that was .
and we love bobby _UNK_ .
do we love bobby _UNK_ .
oh , that bobby _UNK_ .
i love my bobby _UNK_ .
we had so many _UNK_ , _UNK_ and _UNK_ and bobby .
we had so many _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ .
we had so many _UNK_ that came out in our favor .
i do well with _UNK_ .
but the _UNK_ like me .
but bobby was out here working really hard .
and i could see it right at the beginning .
this was going to be the water shed .
but bobby came out and i came out and we went to a _UNK_ -- _UNK_ _UNK_ , you 've never seen so many people .
maybe you 've been at some of the _UNK_ .
it is amazing .
so here is the story , folks .
we have to stop four more years of obama .
we 've got to stop hillary clinton , who is as _UNK_ as they come .
we 've got to bring our country back .
we have to make great trade deals again .
we 're going to make deal that 's bring our jobs back .
and we 're going to get along great with these countries and trade with these countries .
i am not an _UNK_ , i 'm a free _UNK_ .
but i 'm a free trade _UNK_ make great deal -- trade _UNK_ make great deals , not to make _UNK_ deals .
one of the people standing right there , said to me , mr. trump , are you an _UNK_ , and mr. trump -- and i said no .
and what is your _UNK_ of trade ?
and i said very simple .
i know free and i know every form of trade known to mankind .
here is my _UNK_ of trade .
my _UNK_ of `` trade '' is that i want to make great deals for the american people .
you can call it whatever the hell you want .
okay .
and we 're going to .
we 're going to bring our jobs back .
we 're going to bring our manufacturing back .
you look at what has happened to the manufacturing since bill clinton signed probably the worst deal economically in the history of our country , _UNK_ .
that deal was signed by bill clinton .
you look at areas even from here , but you look at places , you look at places like new _UNK_ and new york state and pennsylvania , great state -- we 're leading in pennsylvania by the way .
it just came out .
i hear we 're leading in florida .
i hear we 're leading in ohio .
i hear we 're leading all over the place .
and the _UNK_ poll just came out , we 're leading _UNK_ .
but we have a long way to go .
we are dealing with a _UNK_ system and a _UNK_ system and a _UNK_ system so we have a long way to go folks , and we do n't want anybody to take it away from us .
and when this person said to me , by the way , what you 've done is never done before , congratulations , it does n't even matter if you win or lose the election , what you 've done has never been done before , winning all of the _UNK_ , _UNK_ great professionals and they are very talented people , it has never been done before , you will go down in the history books , mr. trump .
i said do me a favor .
do n't even tell me about it .
because if i do n't win the next one , i will consider it a big , _UNK_ waste of time and $ 55 million i put up , and i 'm still putting up a lot more .
and now we raised $ _UNK_ million last month and we started toward the middle of the month .
and everyone was shocked .
and much of that money came in small _UNK_ like $ _UNK_ average or something like that .
and i put up millions .
but i did it , like , i want to _UNK_ people and i want people to realize , i 'm raising money for the republican party and the _UNK_ .
that is what we want to do .
because we want to keep our majority .
we want to keep our house .
we want to keep our senate .
because i 'll tell you what , if we can do that , and we have trump as president , we are going to be able to do things that are going to be so great for our country .
going to be amazing .
you know , we 're run of the highest _UNK_ nations in the world .
and yet in going around and meeting with people , small business people , big business people , if they had their chance , and if they had their choice , they would rather get rid of rules and regulation -- we have the worst regulations anywhere in the world .
they actually would rather pay more tax , which is surprising , and get rid of these regulations that are _UNK_ everybody .
people ca n't run their businesses .
so we 're going to turn things around .
we 're going to turn them around fast .
we 're not going to lose carrier _UNK_ from _UNK_ .
you know that deal very well .
those people have followed me all over the place .
_UNK_ people , out of jobs , _UNK_ their moving to mexico .
any of the carrier folks in this room ?
because we have -- we have a lot -- look at that .
why are you in the back row .
you should be in the front row .
but we had -- during the season , we had so many of them that followed us around .
they felt so badly .
we 're not going to let that happen .
people and countries take our companies and take our jobs , there are going to be consequences .
they wo n't take them .
because we 're not going to let carrier come in and make _UNK_ in mexico and sell the _UNK_ to us , across a very strong border now , without consequence .
and when we explain to the heads of carrier that here is the story , either stay or if you want to go to mexico , we wish you a lot of luck but when you sell your _UNK_ , you are going to pay a 35 % tax for the _UNK_ to come across the border .
and you know what is going to happen .
they are not going to move .
they 're not going to move .
this government was thinking about low interest loans , zero interest loans and ways to keep our _UNK_ .
you do n't need that .
they do n't need money .
they 're making plenty of money .
but we wo n't let them just take our companies out and fire everybody .
these are people with carrier for many , many years .
we 're not going to let it happen .
and we 're going to have a country that is so smart again .
so here is _UNK_ , folks .
we do n't win any more .
we 're going to start winning .
we 're going to win with our military .
we 're going to kick the hell out of isis .
we have to end it .
we have no choice .
we 're going to take care of our vets .
so important .
our vets are being treated so badly .
i have such great veteran support .
we 're going to take care of our veterans .
we 're going to have strong borders .
we 're going to have the wall -- oh , that wall is going to be as beautiful as a wall could be .
somebody said , mr. trump , sir , they 're going to call it the trump wall .
i said , well then i better build it big and beautiful , right .
no .
no , i do n't want that .
but we need -- we need great borders .
because without borders , we do n't have a country .
we 're going to make great trade deals .
our jobs are going to come back .
we 're going to make a lot of money on trade .
right now we lose all of this money .
you look at japan , the biggest ships you 've ever seen _UNK_ in , and i was in los _UNK_ , they _UNK_ in these massive , massive ships _UNK_ up with cars .
and the cars are _UNK_ just like -- i mean , _UNK_ .
i love _UNK_ .
i love _UNK_ france .
he _UNK_ me from _UNK_ , right .
_UNK_ .
it is like _UNK_ drivers .
king richard _UNK_ me .
a lot of the guys _UNK_ me .
richard petty .
they come in and they are _UNK_ off these boats .
we send them _UNK_ .
we send them _UNK_ .
and when it gets there , they do n't even want it .
they send it back .
you want to see trade _UNK_ , look at the _UNK_ we have with japan .
it will end , folks .
we 're going to have smart people now .
we 're going to make great deals and fair deals and get along great with japan .
we 're going to get along better with these countries and they 're going to treat us fairly .
and we have all of the cards .
just remember that .
we 're the _UNK_ bank .
but they are going to break our _UNK_ bank very soon .
but with the _UNK_ bank , they take the money out .
we have rebuilt china .
the money they 've taken out of this country , i mean they have trains that can he can only dream about .
they have highways that we can only dream about .
places outside of this country in the middle east , different places have airports that we can only dream about .
we used to be at the top .
now we 're like a _UNK_ country .
so here is what i say .
we 're going to start winning again .
we 're going to win so much .
you 're going to be so proud of your country .
we 're going to win so much .
you 're going to be so happy .
you 're going to have your jobs back .
you 're going to have your pride back .
i often joke , you 'll be calling up mike _UNK_ , i do n't know whether he 's going to be your governor or your vice president or who the hell knows .
but you 're going to call up -- good man .
but you 're going to call him and you could either say , governor , or vice president , sir , please , please speak to mr. trump .
we 're winning too much .
we , the people of indiana , can not stand all of these victories .
we ca n't take it .
we 're not used to it .

and say , mr. president , sir , they 're winning too much .
the people of indiana ca n't stand it .
i say , mike , go back and tell them , we 're not changing a _UNK_ thing .
we 're going to keep winning .
and we 're going to win at every level .
and we are going to make america so great again , we 're going to make america greater than ever before .
i love you indiana .
thank you for all of your help .
you 're really special people .
thank you .
we love you .
thank you very much , everybody .
thank you .
thank you .
_UNK_ _UNK_ it is great to be here .
i’d like to thank _UNK_ and all the amazing workers here for hosting us .
today , i am going to talk about how to make america wealthy again .
we are thirty miles from steel city .
pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation .
the legacy of pennsylvania _UNK_ lives in the bridges , railways and skyscrapers that make up our great american landscape .
but our workers’ loyalty was _UNK_ with _UNK_ .
our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization – moving our jobs , our wealth and our factories to mexico and overseas .
globalization has made the financial _UNK_ who _UNK_ to politicians very wealthy .
but it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache .
when _UNK_ foreign steel is _UNK_ into our markets , threatening our factories , the politicians do nothing .
for years , they watched on the sidelines as our jobs _UNK_ and our communities were plunged into _UNK_ unemployment .
many of these areas have still never recovered .
our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families .
skilled _UNK_ and _UNK_ and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands of miles away .
many pennsylvania towns once thriving and _UNK_ are now in a state despair .
this wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class .
it doesn’t have to be this way .
we can turn it all around – and we can turn it around fast .
but if we’re going to deliver real change , we’re going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pushed by powerful corporations , media _UNK_ , and political _UNK_ .
the people who _UNK_ the system for their benefit will do anything – and say anything – to keep things exactly as they are .
the people who _UNK_ the system are supporting hillary clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing will ever change .
the inner cities will remain poor .
the factories will remain closed .
the borders will remain open .
the special interests will remain firmly in control .
hillary clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare america into thinking small – and they want to scare the american people out of voting for a better future .
read : how donald trump says he’d win america’s trade war top u.s. labor leader _UNK_ donald trump in _UNK_ speeches my campaign has the opposite message .
i want you to imagine how much better your life can be if we start believing in america again .
i want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the _UNK_ who’ve led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster after another .
our friends in _UNK_ recently voted to take back control of their economy , politics and borders .
i was on the right side of that issue – with the people – while hillary , as always , stood with the _UNK_ , and both she and president obama predicted that one wrong .
now it’s time for the american people to take back their future .
that’s the choice we face .
we can either give in to hillary _UNK_ campaign of fear , or we can choose to believe in america .
we lost our way when we stopped believing in our country .
america became the world’s _UNK_ economy by becoming the world’s _UNK_ _UNK_ .
the wealth this created was shared broadly , creating the biggest middle class the world had ever known .
but then america changed its policy from promoting development in america , to promoting development in other nations .
we allowed foreign countries to _UNK_ their goods , _UNK_ their _UNK_ , violate their agreements , and cheat in every way _UNK_ .
trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs _UNK_ overseas as a result .
i have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years .
today , we _UNK_ nearly $ _UNK_ billion more in goods than we export .
this is not some natural disaster .
it is _UNK_ disaster .
it is the consequence of a leadership class that _UNK_ _UNK_ over _UNK_ .
this is a direct _UNK_ to our founding fathers , who wanted america to be strong , independent and free .
our founding fathers understood trade george washington said that “the promotion of domestic _UNK_ [ _UNK_ ] will be among the first consequences to flow from an _UNK_ _UNK_ alexander _UNK_ spoke frequently of the _UNK_ of encouraging _UNK_ [ _UNK_ ] in the united _UNK_ the first republican president , abraham lincoln , warned that : “the _UNK_ of the _UNK_ policy by the american _UNK_ must produce want and ruin among our _UNK_ our original constitution did not even have an income tax .
instead , it had _UNK_ – _UNK_ _UNK_ of foreign , not domestic , production .
yet today , _UNK_ years after the revolution , we have turned things completely _UNK_ .
we tax and _UNK_ and restrict our companies to death , then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us _UNK_ .
as a result , we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before .
ladies and gentlemen , it’s time to declare our economic independence once again .
that means _UNK_ two of the worst _UNK_ of the clinton years .
america has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since _UNK_ – even as the country has increased its population by 50 million people .
at the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by bill and hillary clinton .
first , the north american free trade agreement , or _UNK_ .
second , _UNK_ _UNK_ into the world trade organization .
_UNK_ was the worst trade deal in history , and _UNK_ _UNK_ into the world trade organization has _UNK_ the greatest jobs theft in history .
it was bill clinton who signed _UNK_ in _UNK_ , and hillary clinton who supported it .
it was also bill clinton who _UNK_ for _UNK_ disastrous _UNK_ into the world trade organization , and hillary clinton who backed that terrible agreement .
then , as secretary of state , hillary clinton stood by idly while china _UNK_ on its currency , added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits , and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property .
the city of pittsburgh , and the state of pennsylvania , have lost one-third of their manufacturing jobs since the _UNK_ put china into the _UNK_ .
fifty thousand factories across america have shut their doors in that time .
almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result of trade with china .
it was also hillary clinton , as secretary of state , who _UNK_ us into a _UNK_ deal with south korea in 2012. as reported by the economic policy institute in may , this deal doubled our trade deficit with south korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 american jobs .
as _UNK_ _UNK_ said , hillary clinton _UNK_ for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of _UNK_ trade reform , and the negotiation of great trade deals , is the _UNK_ way to bring our jobs back .
to understand why trade reform creates jobs , we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper .
massive trade deficits _UNK_ directly from our gross domestic product .
from _UNK_ to 2001 – a span of over five decades – our _UNK_ gross domestic product grew at a rate of _UNK_ % .
however , since 2002 – the year after we fully opened our markets to chinese imports – that _UNK_ growth rate has been cut almost in half .
what does this mean for americans ?
for every one percent of _UNK_ growth we fail to generate in any given year , we also fail to create over one million jobs .
america’s _UNK_ creation _UNK_ due to _UNK_ growth since 2002 is well over 20 million jobs – and that’s just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put america back to work at decent wages .
the _UNK_ is the greatest danger yet .
the _UNK_ would be the death blow for american manufacturing .
it would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own .
it would further open our markets to aggressive currency _UNK_ .
it would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap _UNK_ goods into u.s. markets – while allowing foreign countries to continue putting barriers in front of our exports .
the _UNK_ would lower _UNK_ on foreign cars , while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep american cars from being sold overseas .
the _UNK_ even created a _UNK_ for china to supply car parts for _UNK_ made in mexico .
the agreement would also force american workers to compete directly against workers from vietnam , one of the lowest wage countries on earth .
not only will the _UNK_ undermine our economy , but it will undermine our independence .
the _UNK_ creates a new international commission that makes decisions the american people can’t veto .
these commissions are great hillary _UNK_ wall street _UNK_ who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the outcomes .
it should be no surprise then that hillary clinton , according to bloomberg , took a _UNK_ part in _UNK_ the trans-pacific _UNK_ .
she _UNK_ or pushed the _UNK_ on 45 separate occasions , and even called it the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
hillary clinton was _UNK_ for the _UNK_ just a short while ago , but when she saw my _UNK_ , which is _UNK_ against , she was _UNK_ into saying she would be against it too – but have no doubt , she will immediately _UNK_ it if it is put before her , guaranteed .
she will do this just as she has betrayed american workers for wall street throughout her career .
here’s how it would go : she would make a small _UNK_ change , declare the _UNK_ fixed , and _UNK_ it through .
that’s why hillary is now only saying she has problems with the _UNK_ “in its current form , ” – ensuring that she can rush to embrace it again at her earliest opportunity .
if the media doesn’t believe me , i have a challenge for you .
ask hillary clinton if she is willing to _UNK_ from the _UNK_ her first day in office and _UNK_ rule out its passage in any form .
there is no way to _UNK_ the _UNK_ .
we need bilateral trade deals .
we do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down .
a trump administration will change our failed trade policy – quickly here are 7 steps i would pursue right away to bring back our jobs .
one : i am going to _UNK_ the united states from the trans-pacific partnership , which has not yet been _UNK_ .
two : i’m going to _UNK_ the toughest and _UNK_ trade negotiators to fight on behalf of american workers .
three : i’m going to direct the secretary of commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers .
i will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under american and international law to end these abuses .
four : i’m going tell our _UNK_ partners that i intend to immediately _UNK_ the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers .
and i don’t mean just a little bit better , i mean a lot better .
if they do not agree to a _UNK_ , then i will _UNK_ notice under article _UNK_ of the _UNK_ agreement that america _UNK_ to _UNK_ from the deal .
five : i am going to _UNK_ my treasury secretary to _UNK_ china a currency _UNK_ .
any country that _UNK_ their currency in order to take advantage of the united states will be met with _UNK_ six : i am going to _UNK_ the u.s. trade representative to bring trade cases against china , both in this country and at the _UNK_ .
_UNK_ unfair _UNK_ behavior is prohibited by the terms of its _UNK_ to the _UNK_ , and i intend to enforce those rules .
seven : if china does not stop its illegal activities , including its theft of american trade secrets , i will use every _UNK_ presidential power to _UNK_ trade disputes , including the application of _UNK_ consistent with section _UNK_ and _UNK_ of the trade act of _UNK_ and section _UNK_ of the trade expansion act of _UNK_ president reagan deployed similar trade measures when _UNK_ and _UNK_ imports threatened u.s. industry .
his _UNK_ on japanese _UNK_ was 45 % and his _UNK_ to shield america’s _UNK_ industry was 100 % .
hillary clinton , and her campaign of fear , will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war .
she has it completely backwards .
hillary clinton unleashed a trade war against the american worker when she supported one terrible trade deal after another – from _UNK_ to china to south korea .
a trump administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the american people .
the era of economic surrender will finally be over .
a new era of prosperity will finally begin .
america will be independent once more .
under a trump presidency , the american worker will finally have a president who will protect them and fight for them .
we will stand up to trade _UNK_ anywhere and everywhere it threatens an american job .
we will make america the best place in the world to start a business , hire workers , and open a factory .
this includes massive tax reform to lift the crushing burdens on american workers and businesses .
we will also get rid of wasteful rules and regulations which are destroying our job creation capacity .
many people think that these regulations are an even greater _UNK_ than the fact that we are one of the highest _UNK_ nations in the world .
we are also going to fully capture america’s tremendous energy capacity .
this will create vast profits for our workers and begin reducing our deficit .
hillary clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines .
a trump administration will also ensure that we start using american steel for american infrastructure .
just like the american steel from pennsylvania that built the empire state building .
it will be american steel that will _UNK_ _UNK_ crumbling bridges .
it will be american steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring into the sky .
it will be american steel that _UNK_ our inner cities .
it will be american hands that remake this country , and it will be american energy – _UNK_ from american resources – that powers this country .
it will be american workers who are hired to do the job .
we are going to put _UNK_ steel back into the backbone of our country .
this alone will create massive numbers of jobs .
on trade , on immigration , on foreign policy , we are going to put america first again .
we are going to make america wealthy again .
we are going to reject hillary _UNK_ politics of fear , _UNK_ , and _UNK_ .
we are going to embrace the possibilities of change .
it is time to believe in the future .
it is time to believe in each other .
it is time to believe in america .
this is how we are going to make america great again – for all americans .
we are going to make america great again for everyone – greater than ever before .
thank you .
